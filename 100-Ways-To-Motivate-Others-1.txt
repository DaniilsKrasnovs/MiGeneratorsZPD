                Introduction


               Time to Play Go Fish


     Don’t believe anything you read in this book.
     Even though these 100 pieces were written from real-
life coaching and consulting experience, you won’t gain
anything by trying to decide whether you believe any of them.
Belief is not the way to succeed here. Practice is the way.
     Grab a handful of these 100 tried and proven ways to
motivate others and use them. Try them out. See what you
get. Examine your results. That’s what will get you what
you really want: motivated people.
     Most people we run into do what doesn’t work, be-
cause most people try to motivate others by downloading
their own anxiety onto them. Parents do this constantly;
so do managers and leaders in the workplace. They get anx-
ious about their people’s poor performance, and then they
download that anxiety onto their people. Now everybody’s
tense and anxious!
     Downloading your anxiety onto other people only mo-
tivates them to get away from you as quickly as possible. It
doesn’t motivate them to do what you really want them to
do. It doesn’t help them get the best out of themselves.

                                                      13
14 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Managers blame their own people for poor numbers,
when it’s really the manager’s responsibility. CEOs blame
their managers, when it’s really the CEO. They call con-
sultants in a panic, talk about the numbers, and then ask,
Do you recommend we implement FISH?
     FISH is a current training fad that has a great deal
of value in inspiring employees and focusing on the cus-
tomer. But we don’t deliver FISH in this book. We deliver
an observation about fish. A fish rots from the head
down, we remind the manager whose people are not per-
forming. And that’s our version of FISH.
     So, the first step in motivating others is for you, if
you’re the leader wanting the motivation, to realize that
if there’s a problem, I’m the problem. Once you truly
get that, then you can use these 100 ways.
     The mastery of a few key paradoxes is vital. They are
the paradoxes that have allowed our coaching and con-
sulting to break through the mediocrity and inspire suc-
cess where there was no success before.
     Paradoxes such as:
     1. To get more done, slow down.
     2. To get your point across, stop talking.
     3. To hit your numbers faster, take them less
         seriously and make a game of it.
     4. To really lead people, go ahead of them.
    These are a few of the paradoxes that open leadership
up into a spiral of success you have never imagined.
    Enjoy this book as much as we enjoyed writing it for
you. We hope you’ll find, as we have, that leadership can
be fun if you break it into 100 easy pieces.
                                        Introduction / 15

    Well, even that’s not completely true. There are actu-
ally 101 Ways in this newly revised paperback version of
the original. We wanted to add in the best motivational
tool of all: inspiration. How you can inspire your people
by letting them watch you grow. Letting them see a be-
fore and after picture of you as you master more and
more skills of excellent leadership. You might even skip
to the last way and read it first, then go on to read the
rest of the book, because by reading the book itself you’ll
be demonstrating Way 101, a bonus for this new edition.

           Know Where Motivation Comes From / 19

                   1. Know Where Motivation
                               Comes From
Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you
              want done because he wants to do it.
                                  —Dwight D. Eisenhower

    There was a manager who came early to a seminar we
were presenting on leadership. He was attired in an olive
green polo shirt and white pleated slacks, ready for a day
of golf.
    He walked to the front of the room and said, Look,
your session is not mandatory, so I’m not planning on
attending.
    That’s fine, but I wonder why you came early to this
session to tell us that. There must be something that you’d
like to know.
    Well, yes, there is, the manager confessed. All I
want to know is how to get my people on the sales team to
improve. How do I manage them?
    Is that all you want to know?
    Yes, that’s it, declared the manager.
    Well, we can save you a lot of time and make sure
that you get to your golf game on time.
    The manager leaned forward, waiting for the words of
wisdom that he could extract about how to manage his
people.
    And we told him:
    You can’t.
    What?
20 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    You can’t manage anyone. So there, you can go and
have a great game.
    What are you saying? asked the manager. I thought
you give whole seminars on motivating others. What do
you mean, I can’t?
    We do give whole seminars on this topic. But one of
the first things we teach managers is that they can’t really
directly control their people. Motivation always comes from
within your employee, not from you.
    So what is it you do teach?
    We teach you how to get people to motivate them-
selves. That is the key. And you do that by managing agree-
ments, not people. And that is what we are going to discuss
this morning.
    The manager put his car keys in his pocket and sat
down in the first seat closest to the front of the room for
the rest of the seminar. He has spent his whole life trying
to manage the behavior and emotions of other people, at
home as well as at work. Therefore, his life was full of
stress and disappointment. We were going to show him
that motivation comes from the inside, not the outside.


                     2. Teach Self-Discipline
           Discipline is remembering what you want.
            —David Campbell, Founder, Saks Fifth Avenue

     The myth that nearly everyone believes is that we have
self-discipline. It’s something in us, like a genetic gift, that
we either have or we don’t.
                              Teach Self-Discipline / 21

     The truth is that we can all have self-discipline. The
question is really whether or not we learn to develop and
use self-discipline.
     Here’s another way to realize it: Self-discipline is like
a language. Any child can learn a language. (All children
do learn a language, actually.) Any 90-year-old can also
learn a new language. If you are 9 or 90 and you’re lost in
the rain in Juarez, it works when you use some Spanish to
find your way to warmth and safety. It works.
     In this case, Spanish is like self-discipline in that you
are using it for something. You were not born with the
language, but you can learn it and use it. In fact, you can
use as much or as little as you wish.
     And the more you use, the more you can make happen.
     If you were an American transferred to Juarez to live
for a year and needed to make your living there, the more
Spanish you spoke, the better it would be for you.
     If you had never spoken Spanish before, you could
still use it like a tool.
     You could open your little English/Spanish phrases
dictionary and start using it. You could ask for directions
or help by using that little dictionary! You wouldn’t need
to have been born with any special language skills.
     The same is true with self-discipline, in the same exact
way. Yet most people don’t believe it. Most people think
they either have it or they don’t. Most people think it’s a
character trait or a permanent aspect of their personality.
     That’s a profound mistake. That’s a mistake that can
ruin a life.
     But the good news is that it is never too late to correct
that mistake in yourself and your people.
22 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Listen to how people get this so wrong:
     He would be my top salesperson if he had any self-
discipline at all, a company leader recently said. But he
has none.
     Not true. He has as much self-discipline as anyone else
does; he just hasn’t chosen to use it yet. Just as we all have
as many Spanish words to draw upon as anyone else.
     It is true that the more often I choose to go to my little
dictionary and use the words, the easier it becomes to use
Spanish. If I go enough times to the book, and practice
enough words and phrases, it gets so easy to speak Spanish
that it seems as if it’s part of my nature, like it’s something
I have inside me. Just like golf looks as if it comes natu-
rally to Tiger Woods.
     Self-discipline is the same.
     If the person you lead truly understood that self-discipline
is something one uses, not something one has, then that
person could use it to accomplish virtually any goal he or
she ever set. That person could use it whenever he wanted,
or leave it behind whenever he wanted.
     Instead, people worry. They worry about whether
they’ve got what it takes. Whether it’s in them. Whether
their parents and guardians put it there. (Some think it’s
put there experientially; some think it’s put there geneti-
cally. It’s neither. It’s never put in there at all. It’s a tool
that anyone can use. Like a hammer. Like a dictionary.)
     Enlightened leaders get more out of their people be-
cause they know that each of their people already has ev-
erything it takes to be successful. They don’t buy the
excuses, the apologies, and the sad fatalism that most non-
performers skillfully sell to their managers. They just don’t
buy in.


     You can’t motivate someone who can’t hear you.
     If what you’re saying is bouncing off their psychologi-
cal armor, it makes little difference how good you are at
saying it. You are not being heard. Your people have to
hear you to be moved by you.
     In order for someone to hear you, she must first be
heard. It doesn’t work the other way around. It doesn’t
work when you always go first because your employee must
first appreciate that you are on her wavelength and under-
stand her thinking completely.
     We were working with a financial services CEO named
Lance who had difficulties with his four-woman major ac-
count team. They didn’t care for him and didn’t trust him,
and they dreaded every meeting with him because he would
go over their shortcomings.
     Lance was at his wit’s end and asked for coaching.
     Meet with each of them one at a time, we advised.
     What do I say?
     Say nothing. Just listen.
     Listen to what?
     The person across from you.
     What’s my agenda?
     No agenda.
24 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

   What do I ask them?
   How is life? How is life for you in this company? What
would you change?
   Then what?
   Then just listen.
   I don’t know if I could do that.
   The source of his major account team’s low morale
had just been identified. The rest was up to Lance.



    A masterful motivator of others asks, What do we want
to cause to happen today? What do we want to produce?
    Those are the best management questions of all. People
who have a hard time managing people simply have a hard
time asking themselves those two questions, because
they’re always thinking about what’s happening to them
instead of what they’re going to cause to happen.
    When your people see you as a cause instead of an
effect, it won’t be hard to teach them to think the same
way. Soon, you will be causing them to play far beyond
their own self-concepts.
    You can cause that to happen. But it all comes from
who you are being from moment to moment. A producer
or a critic?
           Stop Criticizing Upper Management / 25

     We had the opportunity to watch and hear Neale
Donald Walsch speak a couple years ago, and his message
inspired us, as always. It’s amazing who we can be if we
are willing to drop the story of who we think we should be.
In our coaching practice we have always marveled at the
fact that people grow, evolve, and move forward the minute
they are willing to live without their stories about them-
selves (weaknesses) and others (threats). Steve’s book The
Story of You came out of those breakthroughs in coaching
sessions.
     Or, as Walsch has said, Every decision you make—
every decision—is not a decision about what to do. It’s a
decision about Who You Are. When you see this, when
you understand it, everything changes. You begin to see
life in a new way. All events, occurrences, and situations
turn into opportunities to do what you came here to do.
     Choosing to be a producer who causes things to hap-
pen will set you apart from most other people. And that’s
not always easy. Most managers just try to manage like
other people manage, and lose all the potential of who
they could really be by doing that. Or, in the words of the
fiery and brilliant philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, We
forfeit three-fourths of ourselves to be like other people.


                   5. Stop Criticizing Upper
                               Management
       Two things are bad for the heart—running uphill
                  and running down people.
                                        —Bernard Gimbel
26 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    This is a huge temptation: distancing yourself from
your own superiors.
    Maybe you do this to win favor and create bonding at
the victim level with the team, but it won’t work. In fact,
what you have done will eventually damage the confidence
of the team. It will send three messages that are very dam-
aging to morale and motivation:
    1. This organization can’t be trusted.
    2. Our own management is against us.
    3. Yours truly, your own team leader, is weak
        and powerless in the organization.
    This leads to an unpleasant but definite kind of bond-
ing, but it also leads to deep trust problems and further
disrespect for the integrity of the organization. Running
down upper management can be done covertly (a rolling
of the eyes at the mention of the CFO’s name) or overtly
(I don’t know why we’re doing this, no one ever consults
with me on company policy, probably because they know
I’d disagree). This mistake is deepened by the repeated
use of the word they. (They want us to start.... I don’t
know why they are having us do it this way.... They don’t
understand what you guys are going through here.... They,
they, they....)
    The word they used in excess soon becomes a near-
obscenity and solidifies the impression that we are iso-
lated, misunderstood victims.
    A true leader has the courage to represent upper man-
agement, not run it down. A true leader never uses the
word they to refer to senior officials in the company. A
true leader says we.
                                      Do the One Thing / 27

                             6. Do the One Thing
                Management is doing things right;
               leadership is doing the right things.
                                          —Peter F. Drucker

     I can’t motivate others if I am not doing the right thing.
And to keep myself in a relaxed and centered state, it’s
important for me not to be scattered, distracted, or spread
thin.
     It’s important that I don’t race around thinking that
I’ve got too much to do, because I don’t have too much to
do. The truth is, there is only one thing to do, and that is the
one thing I have chosen to do right now.
     If I do that one thing as if it’s all I have to think about,
it will be extremely well done and my relationship with any
other person involved in that task will be better and more
relaxed and full of trust than before.
     A careful study of my past week shows me that I did a
lot of things last week, and they all got done one thing at a
time. In fact, even in my busiest time ever, I was only able
to do one thing at a time, even though I stressed myself
and other people out by always thinking of seven things at
once so that when I talked to you all I could think about
was the seven other people I needed to talk to. Sorry I
seemed so disconnected to you when we talked. I apolo-
gize. And eventually all seven people felt that stress and
that lack of attentiveness—that absolute lack of warmth.
     A person who thinks that he or she should try to do
more than one thing at a time produces fear, adrenaline,
and anxiety in the human system, and others pick up on
28 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

that. That does not warm people, and they eventually want
to keep away from it, so your relationships suffer.
     The mind entertains one thought at a time, and only
one. Why fight it?
     The greatest cause of feeling swamped and over-
whelmed in life is caused by not being willing to slow
down and embrace that one thing the mind can think of.
     The greatest source of stress in the workplace is the
mind’s attempt to carry many thoughts, many tasks, many
future scenarios, many cares, many worries, and many
concerns at once.
     The mind can’t do that.
     No mind can, not even Einstein’s mind could.
     It can only carry one thing.
     Therefore, from now on, I want to choose ONE
THING from the list of things that need to be done, and
then do that one thing as if that were the only thing. If it’s
a phone call, then I need to slow down and relax and let
myself be in a good, focused mood so that the phone call
will be a complete experience, and the recipient and I can
be upbeat afterward.
     Recently we talked to Jason, a national sales manager
who had just finished a brutal, long phone conference with
his team. He spent the conference call nervously urging
on his team to higher numbers and warning them that the
team goals were not going to be met at the rate they were
going. He had called the meeting because his own superi-
ors had just called him to question him about his team’s
poor performance.
     Although Jason had been working 12-hour days, he
felt he was falling behind in everything. On top of that, his
                            Keep Giving Feedback / 29

superiors’ anxiety was then passed down to him. Because
it was passed down into a hectic, disorganized mind, he
freaked out and took it out on his team.
    This is not motivation.
    Motivation requires a calm, centered leader, focused
on one thing, and only one thing.


                  7. Keep Giving Feedback
 The failure to give appropriate and timely feedback is the most
    extreme cruelty that we can inflict on any human being.
               —Charles Coonradt, Management Consultant

     Human beings crave feedback.
     Try ignoring any 3-year-old. At first, he will ask for
positive attention, but if he is continually ignored, soon
you will hear a loud crash or cry, because any feedback,
even negative feedback, is better than no feedback.
     Some people think that this principle only applies to
children. But it applies even more so to adults. The cruel-
est form of punishment in prison is solitary confinement.
Most prisoners will do anything—even temporarily improve
their behavior—to avoid being in a situation with little or
no feedback.
     You may have heard of the relaxing effect of a sensory
deprivation chamber. You are placed for a few minutes in
a dark, cocoon-like chamber, floating in body-temperature
salt water, with all light and sound cut off. It’s great for a
few minutes. But not for long.
30 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     One day the sole attendant at one of those sensory-
deprivation tanks walked off the job in a huff over some
injustice at work, leaving a customer stranded in the cham-
ber. Several hours later, the customer was rescued, but
still had to be hospitalized. Not from any physical harm,
but from the psychosis caused by deprivation of sensory
feedback. What occurs when all outside feedback is cut
off is that the mind manufactures its own sensory feed-
back in the form of hallucinations that often personify the
person’s worst fears. The resulting nightmares and ter-
rors can drive even normal people to the point of insanity.
     Your own people are no different. If you cut off the
feedback, their minds will manufacture their own feed-
back, quite often based on their worst fears. It’s no acci-
dent that trust and communication are the two
organizational problems most often cited by employee
surveys.
     One of the most notorious military and secret intelli-
gence torture devices over the years has been to place a
recalcitrant prisoner into the black room. The time spent
in total sensory deprivation breaks prisoners faster than
physical beatings.
     Let’s take the scene home. The husband is encourag-
ing his wife to get ready for an evening event on time.
     She asks, How does this jacket look on me?
     Fine, just fine, let’s go!
     Well, I knew I didn’t look good in it. I just can’t find
anything else to wear! she says.
     Human beings crave real feedback, not just some pa-
tronizing, pacifying words.
     The managers who have the biggest trouble motivat-
ing their people are the ones who give the least feedback.
                       Get Input From Your People / 31

And when their people say, How are we doing? they say,
Well I don’t know, I haven’t looked at the printout or
anything, but I have a sense that we’re doing pretty well
this month, but I don’t know.
    Those managers have a much harder time inspiring
achievement in their teams. Achievement requires con-
tinuous feedback. And if you’re going to get the most out
of your people, it’s imperative that you be the one who is
the most up on what the numbers are and what they mean,
because motivators do their homework. They know the
score. And they keep feeding the score back to their people.


                                   8. Get Input From
                                        Your People
     I not only use all the brains I have, but all I can borrow.
                                           —Woodrow Wilson

    Good leaders continue to seek creative input from their
direct reports. This practice is not only good for the busi-
ness, it’s also highly motivational for both parties to the
conversation.
    A good leader will ask people on her team, How can
we send a signal over the phone, when the customer calls
with a question, that we are different than the other com-
panies, and they are going to feel more welcome and at
home with us? How do we create a relationship right there
at the point of that call? What are your thoughts on this?
    The quality of our motivational skill is directly related
to the quality of our questions.
32 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    A frustrated manager whose numbers are mediocre
asks the following kind of questions instead of the ques-
tions just asked by our true leader above: How ya doin’?
Wasssup? How was your weekend? How is your depart-
ment today? Up to your neck in it? Swamped as usual?
Are you maintaining? Hang in there, bro. Customers givin’
you a hard time about that new ad? Jerks. I’m dropping
by to check some stuff out. Don’t worry too much, you
guys are cool. I won’t be too hard on you. You know the
drill. Hang in.
    That’s a leader who can’t figure out why his team’s
numbers are low. The quality of that leader’s life is di-
rectly affected by the low quality of his questions. Directly.
    A great leader will ask questions that lead to sales
ideas. A great leader will build a big success on the imple-
mentation of those ideas. Questions such as: How could
we make the buying experience at our company funda-
mentally different, on a personal level, than at the com-
petition? How could we get our people to be like friends
to the customer and get them to hang out with us more
and buy more? How might we reward our own people
for remembering a customer’s name? What are some
of the ways we can inspire our team to get excited about
increasing the size of each sale? Do our people dis-
cuss the concept of creating a customer for life? Have
you gone to a whiteboard and shown them the finan-
cial windfall involved? How do we get everybody brain-
storming this all day long? How do we get the team
more involved in the success of the store? What are
your thoughts?
                                Accelerate Change / 33

                        9. Accelerate Change
  Every organization must be prepared to abandon everything it
                  does to survive in the future.
                                        —Peter F. Drucker

    My role as a leader is always—always—to keep my
people cheered up, optimistic, and ready to play full-out
in the face of change. That’s my job. Most managers do
not see this as their job. They see their job as being
babysitters, problem-solvers, and firefighters. And so they
produce babies, problems, and fires all around them.
    In the face of change, this dysfunction is most pain-
fully revealed. Therefore, it’s important to anticipate the
psychological reaction to change in your employees and
to see how it follows a predictable cycle.
    Your employees pass through these four stages in the
cycle, and you can learn how to manage this passage:
                    The Change Cycle
     1. Objection: This can’t be good.
     2. Reduced Consciousness: I really don’t
        want to deal with this.
     3. Exploration: How can I make this change
        work for me?
     4. Buy-in: I have figured out how I can make
        this work for me and for others.
     Sometimes the first three stages in the cycle take a
long, long time for your people to pass through. Produc-
tivity and morale can take a dizzying dip as employees
resist change. It is human nature to resist change. We all
34 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

do it. We hate to get into the shower and then we hate to
get out.
    But if I am a very good leader, I’ll want to thoroughly
understand the change cycle so that I can get my people to
stage 4—the Buy-in—as soon as humanly possible. I want
their total and deep buy-in to make this change work for
them, for me, and for the company.
    So how do I help move them through stages 1, 2, and 3?
    First of all, I prepare myself to communicate about
this change in the most enthusiastic and positive way pos-
sible. And I mean prepare. As many great coaches have
said, It isn’t the will to win that wins the game, it’s the will
to prepare to win.
    So I want to prepare myself. I want to educate and
inform myself about the change so I can be an enthused
spokesperson in favor of the change.
    Most managers don’t do this. They realize that their
people are resisting the change, so they identify with the
loyal resistance. They sympathize with the outcry. They
give voice to what a hassle the change is. They even apolo-
gize for it. They say it shouldn’t have happened.
    This never should have happened. I’m sorry. With all
you go through already, it’s a shame there’s this now, too.
A remark that cultivates victims!
    Every internal change is made to improve the viability
or effectiveness of the company. That truth is the one I
want to sell. I want my people to see what’s in this for
them. I want them to really see for themselves that a more
viable company is a more secure place to work.
    What about change from the outside? Regulators,
market shifts, vendor problems? In those cases I want to
                   Know Your Owners and Victims / 35

stress to my team that the competition faces the same
changes. When it rains on the field, it rains on both teams.
Then I want to stress the superiority of our team’s rain
strategy so that this rain becomes our advantage.
    I also want to keep change alive on my team as a posi-
tive habit. Yes, we change all the time. We look forward
to change. We even have fun changing before we have to.


                           10. Know Your Owners
                                     and Victims
Those who follow the part of themselves that is great will become
 great. Those that follow the part that is small will become small.
                                                   —Mencius

     The people you motivate will tend to divide themselves
into two categories: owners and victims.
     This distinction comes from Steve’s Reinventing Yourself,
Revised Edition (Career Press, 2005), which reveals in de-
tail how owners are people who take full responsibility for
their happiness, and victims are always lost in their unfor-
tunate stories. Victims blame others, victims blame cir-
cumstance, and victims are hard to deal with.
     Owners own their own morale. They own their response
to any situation. (Victims blame the situation.)
     At a recent seminar, a company CEO named Marcus
approached Steve at the break:
     I have a lot of victims working for me, Marcus said.
     It’s a part of our American culture today, Steve answered.
36 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Yeah, I know, but how can I get them to recognize
their victim tendencies?
     Try something else instead, Steve said. Try getting
excited when they are not victims. Try pointing out their
ownership actions; try acknowledging them when they are
proactive and self-responsible.
     Okay. What are the best techniques to use with each
type of person? Marcus asked. I mean, I have both. I
have owners, too. Do you treat them differently?
     With the owners in your life, you don’t need tech-
niques. Just appreciate them, Steve said. And you will.
With the victims, be patient. Hear their feelings out
empathetically. You can empathize with their feelings with-
out buying in to their victim’s viewpoint. Show them the
other view. Live it for them. They will see with their own
eyes that it gets better results.
     Can’t I just have you come in to give them a seminar
in ownership? Marcus asked.
     In the end, even if we were to train your staff in own-
ership thinking, you would still have to lead them there
every day, or it would be easy to lose. Figure your own
ways to lead them there. Design ways that incorporate your
own personality and style into it. There is no magic pre-
scription. There is only commitment. People who are com-
mitted to having a team of self-responsible, creative, upbeat
people will get exactly that. Leaders whose commitment
isn’t there won’t get it. The three basic things you can do
are: (1) Reward ownership wherever you see it. (2) Be an
owner yourself. (3) Take full responsibility for your staff’s
morale and performance.
     Marcus looked concerned. We could tell he still wasn’t
buying everything.
                  Know Your Owners and Victims / 37

     What’s troubling you? Steve asked.
     Don’t be offended.
     Of course not.
     How do I turn around a victim without me appearing
to be that annoying ‘positive thinker’?
     You don’t have to come off as an annoying positive
thinker to be a true leader. Just be realistic, honest, and
upbeat. Focus on opportunities and possibilities. Focus
on the true and realistic upside. Don’t gossip or run down
other people. There is no reliable trick that always works,
but in our experience, when you are a really strong ex-
ample of ownership, and you clearly acknowledge it and
reward it and notice it in other people (especially in meet-
ings, where victims can hear you doing it), it gets harder
and harder for people to play victim in that setting. Re-
member that being a victim is essentially a racket. It is a
manipulation. You don’t have to pretend that it’s a valid
point of view intellectually, because it is not.
     Okay, I see. That sounds doable, Marcus said. But
there’s one new employee I’m thinking about. He started
out great for a few months, but now he seems so lost and
feels betrayed. That’s his demeanor, anyway. How do I
instill a sense of ownership in him?
     You really can’t ‘instill’ it, said Steve. Not directly.
Ownership, by its nature, is grown by the owner of the
ownership. But you can encourage it, and nourish it when
you see it. You can nurture it and reward it. You can even
celebrate it. If you do all those things, it will appear. Like
a flower in your garden. You don’t make the flower grow,
but if you do certain things, it will appear.
38 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

                      11. Lead From the Front
        You can’t change people. You must be the change
                   you wish to see in people.
                                                 —Gandhi

    There is nothing more motivational than leading from
the front.
    It motivates others when you are out there and you do
it yourself. It’s inspiring to them when you do what you
want them to do. Be inspiring. Your people would rather
be inspired than fixed or corrected. They would rather be
inspired than anything else.
    As a motivational practice, leading from the front hits
harder and lasts longer than any other practice. It changes
people more deeply and more completely than anything
else you can do.
    So be what you want to see.
    If you want your people to be more positive, be more
positive. If you want them to take more pride in their work,
take more pride in yours. Show them how it’s done. If you
want them to look good and dress professionally, look
better yourself. Want them to be on time? Always be early
(and tell them why...tell them what punctuality means to
you, not to them).
    And as General George Patton (a soul mate of
Gandhi’s) said, There are three principles of leadership:
(1) Example, (2) Example, and (3) Example.

                                   Role of Thought
  Great men are they who see that thought is stronger than any
          material force, that thoughts rule the world.
                                   —Ralph Waldo Emerson

     Business and life coach JacQuaeline told us this story
last week about a mechanic in a school district complaining
of punching a time clock and doing the same thing on his
job over and over for the last 20 years.
     I’m burned out and need a change! the mechanic
declared.
     Possibly, JacQuaeline replied. But you might want
to try learning to love what you are resisting, because if
you don’t, you will likely run into it in your next job too, in
another guise.
     The mechanic responded, I can love what I’m resist-
ing? I’m not sure that I believe that’s possible, but even if
I did, how is it done?
     Well, his coach said, what is a higher purpose to
your job than just turning nuts and bolts every day?
     That’s easy, replied the mechanic. The higher pur-
pose of my job is saving children’s lives every day.
     Yes, that’s great! whispered the coach. Now, every
morning when you get into your higher purpose, saving
children’s lives every day, you will be clear that your job
and responsibility is so important that the time clock al-
most won’t matter anymore.
40 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    She had given him a new way to think. She had put him
in touch with the power of higher thought to transform
experience.
    Make certain all the people you want to motivate un-
derstand the role of thought in life. There is nothing more
important.
A: I’m depressed.
B: You just think you’re depressed.
A: Same thing...it feels like the same thing.
B: It feels like the same thing, because it is the same thing.
A: What if I thought I was really happy?
B: I think that would make you feel really happy.
A: I know it would.
    Why is it that the rain depresses one person and makes
another person happy?
    If things make you feel something, why does this
thing called rain make one person feel one thing and the
other person feel the other thing? Why, if things make
you feel something, doesn’t the rain make both people feel
the same thing?
    One person you lead might say, Oh no, bad weather,
how depressing. Another person might say, Oh boy, we
have some wonderful, refreshing rain!
    Because the rain doesn’t actually make you feel any-
thing. (No person, place, or thing can make you feel
anything.)
    It is the thought about the rain that causes your feeling.
And throughout all your leadership adventures, you can
teach your people this most important concept: the causal
power of thought.
                     Preach the Role of Thought         / 41

    One person thinks (just thinks!) the new pay plan is
great. The other person thinks (but just thinks) the plan is
depressing. Nothing in the world has any meaning until
they give it meaning. Nothing in the workplace does ei-
ther. Your people often look to you for meaning. What
does this new directive really mean?
    Do you sense the opportunity you have?
    We can make things mean anything we want them to,
within reason. Why not use that power?
    People don’t make your employees angry; their own
thoughts make them angry. They can’t be angry unless
they think the thoughts that make them angry.
    If your nastiest employee wins the lottery in the morn-
ing, who’s going to make her angry that day? No one. No
matter what anyone says to her, she isn’t going to care.
She’s not going to give it another thought. Your employ-
ees can only get angry with someone if they think about
that person as a threat to their happiness. If they don’t
think about that, how can they be angry?
    Your people are free to think about anything they want.
They have absolute freedom of thought.
    The highest IQ ever measured in any human being was
achieved by Marilyn vos Savant, many years in a row. Some-
one once asked Marilyn what the relationship was between
feeling and thinking. She said, Feeling is what you get for
thinking the way you do.
    People feel motivated only when they think motivated
thoughts. Thought rules. Circumstance does not rule. The
closer your relationship to that truth, the better the leader
you are.

                     13. Tell the Truth Quickly
Question: How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg?
     Answer: Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it a leg.
                                          —Abraham Lincoln

     Great leaders always share a common habit: they tell
the truth faster than other managers do.
     Steve recalls his work with helping managers motivate
salespeople. (And notice that this doesn’t just apply to
salespeople. It applies to all people.)
     I always found that people would tell me about their
limitations, and I would listen patiently and try to talk them
out of their limitations, and they would try to talk me back
into what their limitations really were. Limitation seemed
to be their fixation.
     One day, I was working with a salesperson in a diffi-
cult one-on-one coaching session, and finally I just blurted
it out (I guess I was tired, or upset, or was having a stress-
ful day), and I said, You know, you’re just lying to me.
     What? he said.
     You’re lying. Don’t tell me there’s nothing you can
do. There’s a lot you can do. So let’s you and I work with
the truth, because if we work with the truth and we don’t
lie to each other, we are going to get to your success so
much faster than if we do it this way, focusing on your
self-deceptions.
     Well, my client was just absolutely shocked. He stared
at me for a long time. It’s not always a great relationship-
builder to call someone a liar. I don’t recommend it. If I
hadn’t been as tired as I was, I don’t think I would have
                               Tell the Truth Quickly / 43

done it, but the remarkable thing was, my client all of a
sudden began to smile! He sat back in his chair and he
said, You know what? You are right.
    I said, Really?
    He said, You are right, that’s not the truth at all, is it?
    No, it’s not.
    You are right, he said. There’s a lot I can do.
    Yes, there is.
    This is the main lie you hear in the world of business
and especially in sales: There’s nothing I can do. This is
the I am helpless and powerless lie. The truth is, there is
always a lot you can do. You just have to choose the most
creative and efficient way to do it. As Shakespeare wrote,
Action is eloquence.
    One way a salesperson we know starts her day with
action is to ask herself, If I were coaching me, what would
I advise myself to do right now? What creative action would
bring the highest return to me?
    Another quick cure for the feeling that there’s noth-
ing I can do is to ask ourselves, If I were my customer
or my prospect, what would I want me to do?
    And what you can always do is GIVE. Great sales-
people, and any people who lead their teams in perfor-
mance and who prosper the most from their profession,
are great givers. They stay in constant touch with their
power to do so much by constantly giving their internal
and external clients beneficial things—helpful information,
offers of service, respect for their time, support for their
success, cheerful friendly encounters, sincere acknowledg-
ments, the inside scoop—giving, giving, giving all day long,
always putting the client’s wants and needs first. They al-
ways ask the best questions and always listen better than
44 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

anyone else listens. As that commitment grows and ex-
pands, and those gifts of attention are lavished on each
client in creative and ongoing communications, that sales-
person becomes a world-level expert in client psychology
and buying behavior. And that salesperson also realizes
that such a dizzying level of expertise can only be acquired
through massive benefit-based interaction!
    A new week begins, and this thought occurs: There’s
so much good I can do, I just can’t wait.


       14. Don’t Confuse Stressing Out
                           With Caring
    Stress, in addition to being itself and the result of itself,
                     is also the cause of itself.
                                    —Hans Selye, Psychologist

    Most managers try double negatives as a way to moti-
vate others. First, they intentionally upset themselves over
the prospect of not reaching their goals, and then they use
the upset as negative energy to fire up the team.
    It doesn’t work.
    Stressing out over our team’s goals is not the same as
caring about them. Stressing out is not a useful form of
motivation.
    No performer, when tense, or stressed, performs well.
No leader does. No salesperson. No athlete. No fund-raiser.
No field-goal kicker. No free-throw shooter. No parent.
    A stressed-out, tense performer only has access to a
small percent of his brain. If your favorite team is playing,
                     Manage Your Own Superiors / 45

do you want a tense, stressed-out person shooting a free
throw, or kicking a long field goal in the last moments of
the game? Or would you rather see a confident, calm player
step up to the challenge?
     Most people stress themselves out as a form (or a show)
of really caring about hitting some goal. But it’s not car-
ing, it’s stressing out. Stressing out makes one perform
worse. True caring makes one perform better. That’s why
it’s vital for a leader to know the difference. The two
couldn’t be more different.
     Caring is relaxing, focusing, and calling on all of your
resources, all of that relaxed magic, all of that lazy dyna-
mite you bring to bear when you pay full attention with
peace of mind. No one performs better than when he or
she is relaxed and focused.
     Stress is basically a disconnection from the Earth,
says the great creativity teacher Natalie Goldberg. It’s a
forgetting of the breath. Stress is an ignorant state. It be-
lieves that everything is an emergency.
     It is not necessary to stress that way. Leadership suc-
cess comes from knowing to focus and remain focused.
Anything you pay attention to will expand.
     So don’t spend your attention any old place. Spend it
where you want the greatest results: in clients, customers,
money, whatever. In a relaxed and happy way, you can be
undivided and peaceful and powerful. You can succeed.


       15. Manage Your Own Superiors
        There is no such thing as constructive criticism.

46 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Jean was an administrator in a large hospital system
with which we were working. She welcomed the coaching
work we were doing but had a pressing question about her
own leadership.
    We have had a lot of different bosses to report to,
Jean said. It seems that just when we’re used to working
for a certain CEO, the hospital brings in someone new.
    What exactly is the problem with that? we asked.
    Well, with so many changes in leadership over the years,
Jean asked, how do we develop trust in the process?
    By trusting the process. Trust is not the same as veri-
fication. Trust risks something. And it is not necessarily
bad or good that leadership changes. The question is, can
you teach yourself to live and work peacefully with the
change? It’s not whether it has changed so much, but
rather this: What are you going to do to capitalize on the
change?
    What if we don’t like the leadership now? she pressed
on.
    What don’t you like?
    We get mixed messages from them! Jean said. And
how can you keep asking us to take ownership when we
get mixed messages from senior management?
    Every large organization we have ever worked with
has had to confront, in varying degrees, this issue of ‘mixed
messages.’ Mixed messages happen because people are only
human and it’s hard to coordinate a lot of energetic, cre-
ative people to present themselves as one narrow message.
    I agree, said Jean. But it’s a challenge.
    It’s a challenge that must be dealt with. But it is not
necessary to use it as a source of defeat or depression. It’s
                                Put Your Hose Away / 47

a challenge. We have often seen the ‘message from the top’
become more coherent and unified when the request for
unity ‘from below’ becomes more benevolent and creative.
    You’re saying I should manage them a little better,
Jean said.
    Exactly.
    With the key words being ‘benevolent’ and ‘creative’?
    Those would be the key words.


                      16. Put Your Hose Away
  Wise leaders and high achievers come to understand that they
   can’t hope to eliminate problems...and wouldn’t want to.
                                            —Dale Dauten

     Why are so many managers ineffective leaders?
     Because they are firefighters. When you become a
firefighter, you don’t lead anymore. You don’t decide
where your team is going. The fire decides for you. (The
fire is whatever current problem has flared up and cap-
tured your time and imagination.)
     The fire controls your life. You think you are control-
ling the fire, but the fire is controlling you.
     You become unconscious of opportunity. You become
blind to possibilities, because you are engulfed in, and de-
fined by, the fire.
     If you’re an unmotivational manager, even when you
put the fire out, you hop back on the truck and take off
across the company looking for another fire. Soon, all you
know is fires, and all you know how to do is fight them.
48 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

Even when there is no real fire, you’ll find something you’ll
redefine as a fire because you are a firefighter and always
want to be working.
    A great motivator doesn’t fight fires 24/7. A true moti-
vator leads people from the present into the future. The
only time a fire becomes relevant is when it’s in the way of
that future goal. Sometimes a leader doesn’t even have to
put the fire out. She sometimes just takes a path around
(or above) the fire to get to the desired future.
    A firefighter, on the other hand, will stop everything
and fight every fire. That’s the basic difference between an
unconscious manager (letting the fires dictate activity) and
a conscious leader (letting desired goals dictate activity).


                               17. Get the Picture
    People cannot be managed.... Inventories can be managed,
                     but people must be led.
                                            —H. Ross Perot

    Here’s a question often asked: Isn’t leadership some-
thing people are born with? Aren’t some people referred
to as born leaders?
    Yes, but it’s a myth. Leadership is a skill, like gardening
or chess or playing a computer game. It can be taught and it
can be learned at any age if the commitment to learn is
present. Companies can turn their managers into leaders.
    But if companies could transform all their managers
into leaders, why wouldn’t every company just do that?
               Manage Agreements, Not People / 49

    They don’t know what a leader is. So how can they
train for it? They don’t read books on leadership, they
don’t have leadership training seminars, and they don’t
hold meetings in which leadership is discussed and
brainstormed. Therefore, they can’t define it. So they say
people are born leaders.
    The remedy for this is to always revise your picture of
what a good leader is. People are not motivated by people
who can’t even picture good leadership.
    In his powerful, innovative book on business manage-
ment, The Laughing Warriors (Lumina Media, 2003), Dale
Dauten offers a picture of a leader with a code to work by:
THINK LIKE A HERO (Who can I help today?), WORK
LIKE AN ARTIST (What else can we try?), REFUSE
TO BE ORDINARY (Pursue excellence, then kill it.), and
CELEBRATE (But take no credit.).
    Continuously picturing that code in and of itself would
create leadership.


                    18. Manage Agreements,
                                Not People
Those that are most slow in making a promise are the most faithful
                     in the performance of it.
                                    —Jean-Jacques Rousseau

    Does anybody here work with a person who seems
unmanageable? Steve asked as he opened one of his lead-
ership seminars.
50 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    The managers who filled the room nodded and smiled.
Some rolled their eyes skyward in agreement. They obviously
had a lot of experience trying to manage people like that.
    How do you do it? one manager called out. How
do you manage unmanageable people?
    I don’t know, Steve said.
    What do you mean you don’t know? We’re here to
find out how to do it, someone else called out.
    I’ve never seen it done, Steve said. Because I be-
lieve, in the end, all people are pretty unmanageable. I’ve
never known anyone who was good at managing people.
    Then why have a seminar on managing people if it
can’t be done?
    Well, you tell me, can it be done? Do you actually
manage your people? Do you manage your spouse? Can
you do it? I don’t think so.
    Well, then, is class dismissed?
    No, certainly not. Because we can all stay and learn
how great leaders get great results from their people. But
maybe they do it without managing people, because basi-
cally you can’t manage people.
    If they don’t manage people, what do they do?
    They manage agreements.
    Managers make a mistake when they try to manage
their people. They end up trying to shovel mercury with a
pitchfork, managing people’s emotions and personalities.
    Then they try to take care of their most upset people,
not in the name of better communication and understand-
ing, but in the name of containing dissent and being liked.
    This leads to poor time management and a lot of
ineffective amateur psychotherapy. It also encourages
               Manage Agreements, Not People / 51

employees to take a more immature position in their
communication with management, almost an attempt to
be re-parented by a supervisor rather than having an adult-
to-adult relationship.
     A leader’s first responsibility is to make sure the rela-
tionship is a mature one.
     A skillful leader does not run around playing amateur
psychotherapist, trying to manage people’s emotions and
personalities all day. A skillful leader is compassionate,
and always seeks to understand the feelings of others. But
a skillful leader does not try to manage those feelings.
     A leader, instead, manages agreements. A leader cre-
ates agreements with team members and enters into those
agreements on an adult-to-adult basis. All communication
is done with respect. There is no giving in to the tempta-
tion to be intimidating, bossy, or all-knowing.
     Once agreements are made on an adult-to-adult basis,
people don’t have to be managed anymore. What gets
managed is the agreement. It is more mature and respect-
ful to do it that way, and both sides enjoy more open and
trusting communication. There is also more accountabil-
ity running both ways. It is now easier to discuss uncom-
fortable subjects.
     Harry was an employee who always showed up late for
team meetings. Many managers would deal with this prob-
lem by talking behind Harry’s back, or trying to intimi-
date Harry with sarcasm, or freezing Harry out by not
returning his calls, or meeting with Harry to play thera-
pist. But our client Jill would do none of that.
     Jill co-authored an agreement with Harry that said
Harry (and Jill) would both be on time for meetings.
52 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     They agreed to agree, and they agreed to keep their
commitment to the agreement. It is an adult process that
leads to open communication and relaxed accountability.
Jill has come to realize that when adults agree to keep
their agreements with each other, it leads to a more openly
accountable company culture. It leads to higher levels of
self-responsibility and self-respect.
     The biggest beneficial impact of managing agreements
is on communication. It frees communication up to be
more honest, open, and complete.
     A commitment to managing agreements is basically a
commitment to being two professional adults working to-
gether, as opposed to I’m your dad, I’m your father, I’m
your mother, I’m your parent, and I will re-parent you.
You’re a child, and you’re bad and you’ve done wrong,
and I’m upset with you, and I’m disappointed in you, and
I know that you’ve got your reasons and you’ve got your
alibis and your stories, but still, I’m disappointed in you.
That kind of approach is not management, it’s not leader-
ship, it’s not even professional. That kind of approach,
which we would say eight out of 10 managers do, is just a
knee-jerk, intuitively parent-child approach to managing
human beings.
     The problem with parent-child management is that the
person being managed does not feel respected in that ex-
change. And the most important, the most powerful, pre-
condition to good performance is trust and respect.
     Let’s say my project leader has been assigned to get
the team to do something. The team all agreed to watch a
video and then take a certain test about it given on the
Internet. But then they don’t do it! What does it mean
                Manage Agreements, Not People / 53

that they won’t do things like that? What does it mean
about them? What does it mean about me?
     All it means is that the person in charge of getting that
project done is someone with whom I need to strengthen
my agreement. It’s not someone who’s done something
wrong. I don’t need to call them on the carpet. It’s some-
one with whom I don’t have a very strong agreement.
     And so I need to sit down with him or get into a good
phone conversation with him, and say, You and I need an
agreement on this because this is something that must be
done, and I want to have it done in the way that you can do
it the most effectively, that won’t get in the way of your
day-to-day work. So let’s talk about this. Let me help you
with this so that it does get done. It’s not an option, so you
and I must come up with a way together, that we can both
co-author, together, an agreement on how this is going to
get done.
     Then I should ask these questions of that person: Are
you willing to do this? Is this something you can make
sure your people follow up on? Do you have a way of do-
ing it? Do you need my support?
     And finally, at the end of the conversation, I’ve got
that person agreeing with me about the project.
     Now, notice that this agreement is two-sided. So I also,
as the co-professional in this agreement, am agreeing to
certain things, too.
     That person might have said, You know, one of the
hard things about this is we don’t have anything to watch
this video on, we don’t have a TV monitor in the store.
     And so I would say, If I can get you a TV for your
store, will that be all you need?
54 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Yes, it will.
    Well, here’s what you can count on: By Friday, I’ll have
a TV monitor in the store. What else can I do for you?
    Because a leader is always serving, too. Not just laying
down the law, but serving. And always asking, How can I
assist you? How can I serve you and help you with this?
    Because the true leader wants an absolute promise and
absolute performance.
    And now that we have agreed, I ask very sincerely, Can
I count on you now to have this done, with 100-percent
compliance? Can I count on that from you?
    Yes, of course you can.
    Great. We shake. Two professionals are leaving this
meeting with an agreement they both made out of mutual
respect, out of professional, grown-up conversation. No-
body had to be managed.


                       19. Focus on the Result,
                               Not the Excuse
A leader has to be able to change an organization that is dreamless,
  soulless and visionless...someone’s got to make a wake-up call.
                                            —Warren Bennis

     If you are a sales manager, you probably run into the
same frustrations that Frank conveyed to us when we talked
last week.
     I believe I need advice on how to deliver the ‘Just Do
It’ message to my people, Frank said. I’ve said it every
way I can, and I think I’m starting to sound like a broken
           Focus on the Result, Not the Excuse / 55

record. I don’t know why I called you. I thought maybe
you were advising your clients to pick up some new book
to read, or that you might have some general words of
wisdom.
    What, specifically, is your problem?
    Half of the people on the team I manage are total
non-producers! he said. And I keep telling them...it’s
not magical...it’s getting the leads...and getting it done....
I’ve said, ‘Just get off your butt, and go get referrals, make
60 to 75 phone calls, visit with eight to 10 potential buyers
each week and watch how successful you’ll be.’
    What’s really missing here? we asked him. What’s
wrong with your picture? Why aren’t they out there doing
what would lead to sales?
    That’s why I called you. If I knew what was missing, I
wouldn’t have called you.
    Because it isn’t ‘just doing it’ that is missing from the
non-producers’ equation. Although we always think it is.
What’s really missing runs deeper than that. What’s really
missing is the ‘just wanting it.’
    Oh, I know they all say they want it. They want the
commissions and they want the success.
    They don’t want it, or they would have it.
    Oh, so you think people get everything they want?
    Actually, yes they do.
    Really? I don’t see that.
    That’s what we humans are all about. We know how
to get what we want. We are biological systems designed
to do that.
    We talked longer. There was something we wanted
Frank to see: Frank’s non-producers are under-producing
56 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

because they do not want to produce. Not deep down. If
you are a manager you must understand that. If you are a
non-producer, you must understand that.
     Non-producers are simply not focusing all their atten-
tion on succeeding at selling. If they were, they would be
producers. Even if they say they are focused on results,
they’re not. They are in sales because of other reasons...they
believe they need the money, maybe, and therefore think
they should be there.
     But they can’t get any intellectual or motivational le-
verage from should. Should sets them up for failure
because it implies that they are still a child, and that they
are trying to live up to other people’s expectations—the
expectation of the spouse, family, or society. But there’s
no power in that. No focus. No leverage.
     Salespeople who do what they think they should do
all day convert their managers into parents. Then they age-
regress into childhood and whine and complain. Even when
you try to micromanage their activities, even when you are
eloquent in showing them that Activity A leads to Result B
(always) and Result B leads to Result C (always), they
still do it halfheartedly and search in vain for a new how
to from other mentors and peers.
     Frank now begins to see this form of dysfunction quite
clearly, but he still doesn’t know what to do about it.
     What Frank needs to manage is the want to, not the how
to. Frank needs a quick course in outcome-management
because, like most people, he is stuck in the world of process-
management. The real joy of leadership can only come
when you’re getting results.
           Focus on the Result, Not the Excuse / 57

     Tell me what I, as a manager, ought to do, he said,
after he realized that he already understood this whole
idea.
     Once you get the non-producer’s sales goal (plan,
quota, numbers) in front of you for mutual discussion,
we said, you need to draw out and cultivate the ‘why.’
Ask the person, ‘Why do you want this? What will it do
for you? What else will it do for you? What’s one thing
more it will do for you? If I were to tell you that there
were activities that would absolutely get you to this num-
ber, would you do these activities? If not, why not? Would
you promise both yourself and me that you would do these
activities until you hit the number? Why not?’
     If you’re a manager like Frank, please keep in mind
that you have people who don’t really want what they are
telling you they want, and even they don’t realize that.
You know that if they truly wanted to be producers, noth-
ing in the world could stop them.
     Intention Deficit Disorder is what we have named the
dysfunction that is always at the core of non-production. It
is not a deficit in technique or know-how. Technique and
know-how are hungrily acquired by the person who has an
absolute and focused intention to succeed.
     The real long-term trick to good management is to
hire people who want success. Once you have mastered
that tricky art form, you will always succeed. But we get
lazy in the hiring process and look for and listen for all the
wrong things.
     Why do we do this? Why do we miss this crucial lack
of desire in the hiring process? This is why: the person we
hire really has a big want to—but only when it comes to
getting the job. They really want the job. However, this is
58 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

distinctly different than wanting to succeed at the job.
These are two completely different goals. So we are hazy in
the interviewing process, only half-listening, and we mis-
take the burning desire to get the job with a burning desire
to succeed. It is a completely different and separate thing.
    The best managers we have ever trained always took
more time and trouble in the hiring process than any of
their competitors did. Then, once they had hired ambi-
tious people, they based their management on the man-
agement of those people’s personal goals. When sales
managers learned to link the activity of cold-calling to the
salesperson’s most specific personal goals, cold-calling
became something much more meaningful.
    These managers were spending their days managing
results, not activities. Their positive reinforcement was
always for results, not for activities.


                    20. Coach the Outcome
      Unless commitment is made, there are only promises
                  and hopes...but no plans.
                                       —Peter F. Drucker

    Every non-producer you are managing is in some form
of conflict.
    They say they want to succeed and hit their numbers,
but their activities say otherwise. They themselves can’t even
see it, but you, the manager, can, and it drives you nuts.
    Finally, you have that talk that you always have,
wherein you say to them, I have a feeling that I want this
for you more than you want it for yourself.
                              Coach the Outcome / 59

    And they get misty-eyed and their tears well up while
they insist you are wrong. And you, being such a compas-
sionate person, believe them! So you give them yet an-
other chance to prove it to you. You do all kinds of heroics
for them and waste all your time on them when your time
could be better spent with your producers.
    Always remember that the time you spend helping a
producer helps your team’s production more than the time
you spend with your non-producer.
    Some research we have seen shows that managers
spend more than 70 percent of their time trying to get
non-producers to produce. And most producers, when they
quit for another job, quit because they didn’t get enough at-
tention. They didn’t feel as if the company appreciated them
enough nor could they grow fast enough in their position.
    If you help a producer who is selling 10 muffins a week
learn how to sell 15, you have moved them up to 150 per-
cent of their former level, and, even better, you have added
five muffins to your team’s total. If you were to spend that
time, instead, with a non-producer, and get them up to 150
percent, you might have just moved them up from two
muffins to three. You’ve only added one muffin (instead
of five) to the team total. Most managers spend most of
their days with the non-producer...adding one muffin to
the team’s total.
    Managers need to simplify, simplify, simplify. They do
not need to do what they normally do: complicate,
multitask, and complicate.
    Keep it as simple as you can for your non-producers,
focusing on outcomes and results only. Spend more and
more time with producers who are looking for that extra
edge you can give them.
60 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Non-producers have a huge lesson to learn from you.
They could be learning every day that their production is
a direct result of their own desire (or lack of it) to hit that
precise number. People figure out ways to get what they
want. Most non-producers want to keep their jobs (be-
cause of their spousal disapproval if they lose it, because
of their fear of personal shame if they lose it, and so on),
so all their activity is directed at keeping the job from one
month to the next. If they can do the minimum in sales
and still keep their job, they are getting what they want.
People get what they want.
    The manager’s challenge is to redirect all daily effort
toward hitting a precise number. If your people believed
that they had to hit that number, they would hit that
number, and technique would never be an issue. Skills
would never be an issue. They would find them. They
would try out every technique in the book until that num-
ber appeared.
    Somehow, non-producers have convinced themselves
that there is no direct cause and effect between increasing
certain activities and hitting their numbers.
    Do you remember those little toy robots or cars you
had when you were a kid that would bump into a wall and
then turn 30 degrees and go again? If you put one of those
toys in a room with an open door, it will always find the
way out the door. Always. It is programmed to do so. It is
mechanically programmed to keep trying things until it is
out of there.
    That’s also what top producers program themselves
to do. It’s the same thing. They keep trying stuff until they
find a way. If they bump into a wall, they immediately turn
30 degrees and set out again.
                               Coach the Outcome / 61

    The non-producer bumps into the wall and gets de-
pressed and then shuts himself down. Sometimes for 20
minutes, sometimes for a whole day or week. Alternately,
he bumps into a wall and doesn’t turn in any other direc-
tion, so he keeps bumping into the same wall until his bat-
teries run down. Death of a salesman.
    Managers also make the mistake of buying in to their
non-producers’ perceived problems. They buy in to the
non-producers’ never-ending crusade to convince every-
one that there is no cause and effect in their work. It’s all
a matter of luck! In fact, non-producers almost delight in
bringing back evidence that there is no cause and effect.
They tell you long case histories of all the activities they
did that led to nothing. All the heartbreak. All the times
they were misled by prospective buyers.
    A manager’s real opportunity is in teaching his people
absolute respect for personal responsibility and results.
Everyone selling in the free market is 100-percent account-
able for his or her financial situation. Every salesperson is
outcome-accountable as well as activity-accountable.
    Your non-producers will always want to sell you on
what they have done, all the actions they have taken. What
they don’t want is to take responsibility for outcomes. Good
sales management is outcome management, not activities
management. Yet most sales managers go crazy all day
managing activities.
    Why? Because they know that if you really do these
activities without ceasing, you will get results. So they
manage the activities. They need to change that and
manage results. They need to hold people accountable
for the results they are getting, and not how hard they
are trying. The minute a manager falls for how hard
62 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

people are trying, he has broken the cause-and-effect
link.
    If you, as manager, ask them, How much X do you
do? they will ask, How do I learn a better technique for
X? And while better techniques are always good, it’s not
the point here. You are now discussing results. They will
subconsciously try to steer you away from results into tech-
nique. Just like a child does with a parent! Dad, I tried,
but I can’t! I can’t do it! Discuss technique after the com-
mitment to results is clarified.
    Non-producers, at the deepest level, do not yet want
to get the result. You have to understand this so you won’t
go crazy trying to figure them out. They don’t want the
result. They want the job. They want your approval. They
want to be seen as really trying. But deep down, they
don’t want the result. It’s that simple.
    The truly great managers spend most of their time
helping good producers go from 10 muffins to 15. They
have fun. They are creative. They feed off of their pro-
ducers’ skills and enthusiasm. Their teams constantly out-
perform other teams. Why? Because other teams’ managers
have been hypnotized by their non-producers. Their non-
producers actually become good salespeople selling the
wrong thing. Selling you the worst thing: there is no cause
and effect...there is no guarantee.
    Simplify. Focus on results. You will always get what
you focus on. If you merely focus on activities, that’s what
you’ll get: a whole lot of activities. But if you focus on
results, that’s what you’ll get: a whole lot of results.

                                21. Create a Game
         Although some people think that life is a battle,
           it is actually a game of giving and receiving.
               —Florence Scovel Shinn, Philosopher/Author

    Complete this sentence with the first word that pops
into your head: Life is a ____.
    What came to mind first? (Let’s hope the popular
bumper sticker, Life is a Bitch and Then You Die did
not come to mind.)
    Whatever comes to mind first, here’s something that you
(and we) can be sure of: that is exactly how life now is for you.
    What was your answer? In a poll of mid-level manag-
ers, the most common answer was Life is a battle. But
in a poll of senior executives, the most common answer
was Life is a game.
    Which version of life would you choose if you had a
choice?
    To be as motivational a leader as you can possibly be,
you might want to show your people that life with you is a
game.
    What makes any activity a game? There needs to be
some way to keep score, to tell whether people are win-
ning or losing. Then it becomes pure fun.
    So be clear that although all kinds of prizes may be
attached to the game, the game itself is being played for
the sheer fun of it.
    How can you incorporate this into your life?
64 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Chuck Coonradt, a longtime friend and mentor, is a
management consultant and the best-selling author of The
Game of Work. He has created an entire system for mak-
ing a game out of work.
    Chuck recalled that when he started in the grocery
business, in the icy frozen-food section of the warehouse,
he noticed that the owners would bend over backwards to
take care of their workers. They would give them breaks
every hour to warm up and they would give them prefer-
ential pay. But no matter what they did, the workers would
bitterly complain about the chilling cold.
    However, you could take these exact same workers
and put a deer rifle into their hands, Chuck said, and
you could send them out into weather that was much worse
than anything in the warehouse, and they would call it fun!
And you wouldn’t have to pay them a dime! In fact, they
would pay for it themselves!
    The key to making work fun, as Tom Sawyer taught us
many years ago, is to turn what most people would con-
sider drudgery into a game.
    Randy was a leader-client of ours who had a problem
with absenteeism. For many months he tried to attack and
eliminate the problem. Finally, he realized that it might
be possible to lighten things up by introducing the game
element.
    So Randy created a game. (Leaders create; managers
react.) He issued a playing card to every employee who
achieved perfect attendance for the month. A card was drawn
at random from a bucket of cards. The employee then put
the card up in his or her cubicle. At the end of six months,
the person with the best poker hand won a major prize; the
second and third best hands also won good cash prizes.
                                   Create a Game / 65

    My absenteeism problem virtually disappeared, Randy
later recalled. In fact, we had some problems with actual
sick people trying to work when they shouldn’t have. They
would wake up with a fever, and their spouse would say,
‘You’re staying home today,’ and they would say, ‘Are you
crazy? I’m holding two aces and you want me to stay home?’
    After being in business for four years selling a pre-
packaged management development program, Chuck
Coonradt made what became the most important sales call
of his career.
    He called on a plant manager in a pre-constructed
housing company. As part of their discussion, the manager
began to give Chuck the Kids Today lecture—kids don’t
care, kids won’t work, kids don’t have the same values you
and I had when we were growing up.
    As he was speaking, we were looking over the factory
floor from the management office 30 feet above the fac-
tory floor, Chuck recalled. He pointed down to the eight
young men siding a house and said, ‘What are you and
your program going to do about that?’
    Chuck said that he looked at their work pace and said
that it would best be compared to arthritic snails in wet
cement. These guys appeared to be two degrees out of
reverse and leaning backwards! He had given me objec-
tions for which I didn’t have an answer. I really didn’t
know what to say.
    Then an amazing thing occurred—lunch. As soon as
the lunch bell rang, these eight workers dropped their ham-
mers as if they were electrified, took off on a dead run as
if being stuck with cattle prods, four of them taking off
their shirts, running 50 yards down the factory floor to a
basketball court.
66 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     The motivational transformation was amazing! Chuck
watched the game, mesmerized, for exactly 22 minutes.
Everybody knew their job on the court, did their job on
the court, and supported the team with energy, engage-
ment, and enthusiasm—all without management. They
knew how to contribute to the teams they were on, and
they enjoyed it.
     At 12:22 the game stopped, they picked up their sack
lunches and their sodas, and began to walk back to their
workstations, where, at 1 p.m., they were back on the
clock—arthritic snails back in the wet cement.
     Chuck turned to the plant manager and said, I don’t
believe there is a raw human material problem. I don’t
think there is anything wrong with these kids’ motivation.
     And on that day, Chuck began a quest to see if it would
be possible to transfer the energy, enthusiasm, and en-
gagement that he saw on the basketball court to the fac-
tory work floor. His success at doing so has become
legendary throughout the business world.
     Now we identify the motivation of recreation and bring
it to the workplace, Chuck says. The motivation of rec-
reation includes feedback, scorekeeping, goal-setting, con-
sistent coaching, and personal choice.


                       22. Know Your Purpose
There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should
                        not be done at all.
                                         —Peter F. Drucker
                                Know Your Purpose / 67

     It is hard to motivate others if you don’t have time to
talk to them. There are fewer discouraging sights than a
human chicken running around with his head cut off—
and not enough time to find it.
     Managers whose teams are not performing up to ex-
pectations are simply doing ineffective things all day.
Rather than stopping and deciding what would be the right
thing to do, they do the wrong things faster and faster.
Then they stress out over the workload. (There is no
workload to worry about if you are doing the right thing.
There is only that thing.)
     And as corporate time-management specialist David
Allen says of today’s busy leaders: You have more to do
than you can possibly do. You just need to feel good about
your choices.
     Multitasking is the greatest myth in modern-day busi-
ness. The thinking part of the brain itself does not multitask,
and so people do not really multitask. The human system
is not set up that way. The brain experiences and holds
only one thought at a time.
     Managers often think they are multitasking, but they
are really just doing one thing badly and then quickly mov-
ing to another thing, doing it badly and quickly. Soon
they’re preoccupied with all the tasks they’ve touched but
left incomplete.
     Business efficiency expert Kerry Gleeson said, The
constant, unproductive preoccupation with all the things
we have to do is the single largest consumer of time and
energy. Not the things we do, the things we think we still
have to do.
     People who find the joy in leadership find ways to re-
lax into an extremely purposeful day, goal-oriented and
68 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

focused on the highest-priority activity. They relax into
every given moment. Sure they get distracted, and sure,
people call them and problems come up. But they know
what to return to. Because they know their purpose. Be-
cause they chose it.
    That’s the kind of leader that is admired and followed.


                     23. See What’s Possible
 Outstanding leaders go out of the way to boost the self-esteem
      of their personnel. If people believe in themselves,
            it’s amazing what they can accomplish.
                                             —Sam Walton

    One of the best ways to motivate others is to learn
from those who have motivated you. Learn from the great
leaders you have had. Channel them, clone them, and in-
corporate them into who you are all day.
    Scott Richardson recalls: The most effective, inspi-
rational motivator that I ever had was a violin prodigy who
was my violin teacher.
    That teacher was an associate professor of music at
the University of Arizona named Rodney Mercado. I met
him when I was 16 and ready to quit the violin. My mother,
who desperately wanted me to be a violin player said, Hang
on, I’ll find you the best teacher out there.
    I was skeptical. But one day, she came in and said to
me, I found him; he’s the teacher of your teacher.
    The first time I met him, I had to audition for him. I’d
never had to audition for a teacher before. Usually you’d
                              See What’s Possible / 69

just pay the money, and they took you. But Professor
Mercado chose his students carefully, just as a great leader
chooses his team.
     And I did the absolutely worst audition I’d ever done
in my life! I thought, Well, that sealed it. I don’t have to
worry about having him for my teacher.
     Soon after, he called me on the phone and said, I’ve
accepted you.
     And I thought, There must be some mistake, this can’t
be true. I mean, my playing was so horrible, I couldn’t
imagine anyone accepting me based on that audition.
     But he had the ability to see what was possible in other
people. If anyone else had heard my audition, he would
have said that it was hopeless. But he heard more than the
playing. He heard the possibility behind the playing.
     And in that, he was a profoundly great coach and leader,
because one of the most vital aspects of motivating others
is the ability to see what’s possible instead of just seeing
what’s happening now.
     Ever since that time, I’ve learned not to give up on
people too quickly. I’ve learned to look deeply and listen
deeply. Soon, skills and strengths I never saw before in
people would show up.
     I learned that people perform in response to who they
think they are for us at the moment. In other words, how
they think we see them is how they perform for us; there-
fore, if we can create a new possibility for them, and com-
municate that to them, their performance instantly takes
off.
     Professor Mercado showed me another example of the
power of communicating possibility when he was teaching
70 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

a boy named Michael, who later became a good friend of
mine.
     Michael was unusual. When he was in junior high, as
far as I could guess, he had never ever cut his long black
hair because it was longer than his sister’s, which was down
below her belt. And Michael always kept his hair in front
of his face, so you actually couldn’t see what he looked
like. And he never spoke a word in public.
     His parents asked Professor Mercado if he would be
willing to teach Michael the violin. Mercado agreed and
they had lessons, but as far as any outsider could tell, it
was strictly a one-way communication. Michael never re-
sponded outwardly. He never even picked up the violin!
     Yet Mercado continued to teach him, week after week.
     And then one day, when he was in 8th grade, Michael
picked up the violin and started playing. And in less than
a month, he was asked to solo in front of the Tucson
Symphony!
     I could see for myself that this happened because Pro-
fessor Mercado communicated to Michael (without any
outward acknowledgment that communication was being
received) that who Michael was (for Professor Mercado)
was a virtuoso violinist. He communicated possibility.
     So I have always remembered from this experience
that people’s performance is a response to who they per-
ceive themselves to be for us at the moment. Once we
create a new possibility for those around us, and commu-
nicate to them that this new possibility is who they are for
us, their performance instantly takes off.
     There’s no better way to motivate another human being.
                 Enjoy the A.R.T. of Confrontation / 71

                         24. Enjoy the A.R.T. of
                                 Confrontation
     To command is to serve, nothing more, and nothing less.
                      —André Malraux, French Philosopher

     One of the tricks we teach to inspire increased moti-
vation in others is what we call The A.R.T. of Confronta-
tion. It shows leaders how to enjoy holding people
accountable.
     Most managers think it’s impossible to enjoy holding
people accountable. They think it’s the hard part of being
a manager. They think it’s one of the downsides—a neces-
sary evil associated with the burden of command.
     Therefore you can see why they don’t do a very good
job of holding people accountable.
     Fortunately, there is an enjoyable way to do it.
     When you need to speak to an employee about a be-
havior or a performance level that is not working for you,
experiment with using this A.R.T:
     A: First, appreciate and acknowledge the employee
for who she is, what she brings to the organization, noting
specific strengths and talents. Then give a very, very spe-
cific recent example of something that employee did that
particularly impressed and benefited you.
     R: Next, restate your own commitment to that per-
son. I believe in you. I hired you because of what I saw in
you. I see even more in you than when I hired you. I am
committed to your success here. I am devoted to your
career, to you being happy and fulfilled. Then, tell that
72 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

employee exactly and specifically what she can count on,
always, from you. List what you do, how you fight for fair
pay, how you are available at all times, how you work to
always get the employee the tools she needs for success,
and so on.
    This recommitment places the conversation in the
proper context. Ninety percent of managerial reprimands
are destructive to the manager-employee relationship be-
cause they are felt to be out of context. The big picture
must be established first, always.
    T: Last, track the agreement. You want to track the
existing agreement you have with your employee (if there
is one) about the matter in question. If there is no existing
agreement, you should create one on the spot. Mutually
authored with mutual respect.
    Agreements are co-creations. They are not mandates
or rules. When an agreement is not being kept, both sides
need to put all their cards on the table in a mutually sup-
portive way to either rebuild the agreement or create a
new agreement. People will break other people’s rules. But
people will keep their own agreements.


                25. Feed Your Healthy Ego
  Learning to be a leader is the same process as learning to be an
                 integrated and healthy person.
                                             —Warren Bennis

    High self-esteem is our birthright. It is the core spirit
inside of us. We do not need to pass a battery of humiliating
                            Feed Your Healthy Ego / 73

tests to attain it. We need only to drop the thinking that
prevents it. We need to get out of its way and let it shine,
in ourselves and in others.
    Masterful, artful, spirited leadership has ways of bring-
ing out the best and the highest expression of self-esteem
in others.
    But it starts at home with me. If I’m a leader, it starts
with my own self-confidence. We human beings find it
easier to follow self-confident people. We are quicker to
become enrolled in a project when the person enrolling us
is self-confident.
    Most managers today don’t take time to raise their
own self-esteem and get centered in their personal pride
of achievement. They spend too much time worrying about
how they are being perceived, which results in insecurity
and low self-esteem.
    Nathaniel Branden, in his powerful book Self-Esteem
at Work (Jossey-Bass, First Edition, 1998), says it this way:
      A person who feels undeserving of achievement
      and success is unlikely to ignite high aspirations
      in others. Nor can leaders draw forth the best in
      others if their primary need, arising from their
      insecurities, is to prove themselves right and
      others wrong, in which case their relationship
      to others is not inspirational but adversarial. It
      is a fallacy to say that a great leader should be
      egoless. A leader needs an ego sufficiently healthy
      that it does not perceive itself as on trial in ev-
      ery encounter—is not operating out of anxiety
      and defensiveness—so that the leader is free to
      be task and results-oriented, not oriented to-
      ward self-aggrandizement or self-protection.
74 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     A healthy ego asks: What needs to be done? An
     insecure ego asks: How do I avoid looking bad?
    Build your inner strength by doing what needs to be
done and then moving to the next thing that needs to be
done. The less you focus on how you’re coming across,
the better you’ll come across.


                         26. Hire the Motivated
   The best executive is the one who has sense enough to pick
   good people to do what he wants done, and self-restraint to
        keep from meddling with them while they do it.
                                      —Theodore Roosevelt

    It sounds too simple. But the best way to have people
on your team be motivated is to hire self-motivated people.
    But isn’t that just the luck of the draw? No. There is
much you can do to create this kind of team. Let’s start
with the hiring interview.
    As you conduct your hiring interview, know in advance
the kinds of questions that are likely to have been antici-
pated by the interviewee, and therefore will only get you a
role-played answer. Minimize those questions.
    Instead, ask questions that are original and designed
to uncover the real person behind the role-player. Ask the
unexpected. Keep your interviewee pleasantly off-balance.
The good, motivated people will love it, and the under-
motivated will become more and more uncomfortable.
    Know that every interviewee is attempting to role-play.
                                Hire the Motivated / 75

They are playing the part of the person they think would
get this job. We all do it in an interview. But your job is to
not let it happen.
    One way to find the true person across from you is
called layering. Layering is following up a question with an
open-ended, layered addition to the question. For example:
    Question: Why did you leave Company X?
    Answer: Not enough challenges.
    Layered Question: Interesting, tell me more about
Company X. What was it like for you there?
    Answer: It was pretty difficult. I wasn’t comfortable.
    Layered Question: Why do you think it affected you
that way?
    Answer: My manager was a micromanager.
    Layered Question: This is very interesting; talk more
about that if you can.
    Basically, layering is a request you make that your
interviewee go further and further beyond his pre-rehearsed
story. You ask him to go on, then keep going, then
tell me more, and then go on.
    Layering uncovers the real person after a while. So do
questions that have not been anticipated and rehearsed
for a role-play. Here’s an example of a very open-ended
and curious exchange:
    Did you grow up here?
    No, I grew up in Chicago.
    Chicago! Did you go to high school there?
    Yes I did, Maine East High.
    What was that like, going to that school?
    Another example:
76 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    How was your weekend?
    Great.
    What is a typical weekend like for you?
    Or another:
    I see from your resume that you majored in engi-
neering.
    Yes.
    If you had one thing to change about how they teach
engineering, what would you change?
    Or another:
    If you were asked to go back to run the company you
just came from, what’s the first thing you would do?
    Think of questions that you yourself like and are in-
trigued by, and keep your interviewee in uncharted waters
throughout the interview. That way you get the real per-
son to talk to you so you’ll get a much better gut feeling
about the person and what he or she would be like to work
with.
    The best way to create a highly motivated team is to
hire people who are already motivated people.


                                   27. Stop Talking
       One measure of leadership is the caliber of people
                  who choose to follow you.
                —Dennis A. Peer, Management Consultant

   Most job interviewers talk way too much, and they go
way too soon to the question, Well, is there anything you
would like to know about us?
                                       Stop Talking / 77

     Learn to stop doing that. That’s your ego being ex-
pressed, not a good interview technique. People who have
not done their homework and who are not masterful in-
terviewers will always end up interviewing themselves and
talking about their company. Totally unproductive.
     They get uncomfortable asking lots of questions so
they quickly start talking about the history of the com-
pany, their own history there, and many personal convic-
tions and opinions. In this, they are wasting their time.
In five months, they will be wringing their hands and tear-
ing their hair out because somehow they let a problem
employee and chronic complainer fly in under the radar.
And it will keep happening until you learn to interview.
     Remember: no talking. Your job is to intuit the moti-
vational level of the person across from you. You can only
do that by letting her answer question after question.
     It takes more courage, imagination, and preparation
to ask a relentless number of questions than it does to
chat. Great leaders are great recruiters. In sports and in
life. As a leader, you’re only as good as your people. Hire
the best.
     Dale Dauten, often called the Obi-Wan Kenobi of
business consultants, said, When I did the research that
led to my book The Gifted Boss (William Morrow, First
Edition, 1999), I found that great bosses spend little time
trying to mold employees into greatness, but instead devote
extraordinary efforts to spotting and courting exceptionally
capable employees. Turns out that the best management
is finding employees that don’t need managing.

                                28. Refuse to Buy
                                  Their Limitation
    Leaders don’t create followers, they create more leaders.
                 —Tom Peters, Author/Business Consultant

     Your people limit themselves all the time. They put up
false barriers and struggle with imaginary problems.
     One of your skills as a leader will be to show your
people that they can accomplish more than they think they
can. In fact, they may someday be a leader like you are.
One of the reasons your people will wind up admiring you
is that you always see their potential. You always see the
best side of them, and you tell them about it.
     It could be that you are the first person in that
employee’s life to ever believe in him. And because of you,
he becomes more capable than he thought he was, and he
loves you for that, even though your belief in him some-
times makes him uncomfortable. That discomfort may
return every time you ask him to stretch. But you don’t
care. You press on with your belief in him, stretching him,
growing him.
     One of the greatest leadership gurus of American busi-
ness was Robert Greenleaf. He developed the concept of
servant leadership. A leader is one who serves those fol-
lowing, serving them every step of the way, especially by
bringing out the best in them, and refusing to buy their
limitations as achievers.
     Your people may be flawed as people, but as achiev-
ers, they are certainly not.
            Play Both Good Cop and Bad Cop / 79

     Greenleaf said, Anybody could lead perfect people—
if there were any. But there aren’t any perfect people. And
parents who try to raise perfect children are certain to
raise neurotics.
     It is part of the enigma of human nature that the ‘typi-
cal’ person—immature, stumbling, inept, lazy—is capable
of great dedication and heroism if wisely led. The secret
of team-building is to be able to weld a team of such people
by lifting them up to grow taller than they would other-
wise be.


                    29. Play Both Good Cop
                              and Bad Cop
If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more,
                and become more, you are a leader.
                                       —John Quincy Adams

    If you are an effective motivator of others, then you
know how to play good cop, bad cop. And you know
that you don’t need two people to play it. A true motivator
plays both roles.
    Good Cop: Nurturing, mentoring, coaching, serving,
and supporting your people all the way. Keeping your word
every time. Removing obstacles to success. Praising and
acknowledging all the way. Leading through positive rein-
forcement of desired behavior, because you’re a true leader
who knows that you get what you reward.
    Bad Cop: Bad to the bone. No compromise about
people keeping their promises to you, even promises about
80 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

performance. No room for complaints and excuses as sub-
stitutions for conversations about promises not being kept.
No respect for whiners and people who do not make their
numbers. No wiggle room for the lazy. Clarity, convic-
tion, determination. All cards on the table. No covert mes-
sages. In your face: I believe in you. I know what you can
do. When you don’t do it, you let yourself and the team
down. I won’t allow that. Time to wake up.
     Obviously you don’t call on Bad Cop every day. Only
after every Good Cop approach is exhausted. But Bad Cop
can be a great wake-up call to someone who has never
been challenged in life to be the best she can be. And once
the Bad Cop session is over, and the person is back in the
game, giving it a good effort, bring Good Cop back right
away to complete the process.


                               30. Don’t Go Crazy
   The older I get the more wisdom I find in the ancient rule of
 taking first things first. A process which often reduces the most
       complex human problem to a manageable proportion.
                                   —Dwight D. Eisenhower

     When I’m thinking about seven things rather than one,
I’m trying to keep them in my head while I’m trying to
listen to you, but I really can’t because I just thought of
three more things that I need to attend to when you leave,
which I hope will be soon.
     So I look at my watch a couple of times while you’re
talking to me, because mentally I’m on the run, and I’m a
type-A go-go-guy, doing a million things! But what I’m
                                       Don’t Go Crazy / 81

not seeing is that my very fragile relationship with you is
being destroyed by this approach. It’s being destroyed a
little bit at a time, because the main message I’m sending
to you and everyone else on my team is that I’m really
stressed, and it’s crazy here inside my head.
     I even tell my family, It’s crazy at work. I want to
spend more time with you, but it’s crazy right now. Just
crazy at the office.
     Well, it’s not crazy. You’re crazy. You need to be hon-
est about it. It’s not crazy; it’s just work. It’s just a business.
     It’s-crazy-around-here managers keep throwing up
their hands, saying, What? She’s leaving us? Why? She’s
quitting? Oh no, you can’t trust anybody these days. Get
her in here, we need to save this. Cancel my meetings,
cancel my calls, I want to find out why she’s leaving.
     Well, she’s leaving for this reason: You only spoke to
her for a maximum of three minutes in any single conver-
sation over the past year. You may have spoken to her 365
times, but it was only for three minutes. This is not a pro-
fessional relationship. It’s drive-by management.
     And whether the go-go manager likes it or not, creat-
ing great relationships is how careers are built, how busi-
nesses are built, and how great teams are built.
     Usually, people who think they admire or in a certain,
frightened, way respect their multitasking managers,
admit that they feel less secure because of all that is
crazy.
     When they meet with that manager, the manager says
to them, Okay, come on in, I know you need to see me.
Get in here, I have to take this call. It’s crazy. I’ve got to
be in a meeting in two minutes, and there’s an e-mail I’m
waiting for, so you’ll forgive me if I jump on that when it
82 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

comes in, but just step in here for a second. I know you
had something on your mind. So please, ah, talk to me...oh,
excuse me.
    When we can get a manager to experiment with slow-
ing down and becoming focused on each conversation as a
way to approach his or her day, they’re really amazed. If
they do it for a week, they call back and say, Unbeliev-
ably, I got more understanding of my people this week
than in all my previous weeks on this job.
    Yet it could be different. Life could slow down and
become excellent. Because often, when they do slow down
and look at the next urgent task in front of them, it occurs
to them that someone else would love to do this task. Not
only that, but someone else would be flattered to do this.
They would enjoy hearing of the trust I have in them by
asking them to take this over and get it done, and done
well, because I like the way they do things.
    There are so many things that can be delegated and
passed on to others, but only if you regain your sanity and
slow down. One of the best ways to motivate others is to
give them more interesting things to do. Especially things
that free up your own time. That’s time you can use to
build a motivated team. It doesn’t have to be crazy around
here. You can put an end to that.


                         31. Stop Cuddling Up
          I never gave them hell. I just tell the truth
                   and they think it’s hell.
                                          —Harry S. Truman
                                 Stop Cuddling Up / 83

     Unconsciously, managers without leadership habits will
often seek, above all else, to be liked. Rather than holding
people accountable, they let them off the hook. They give
non-performers the uneasy feeling that everything’s fine.
They are managers who seek approval rather than success.
     But this habit has a severe consequence. It leads to a
lack of trust in the workplace. Lack of trust: the most
common problem issue on employee surveys.
     A true leader does not focus on trying to be liked. A
true leader focuses on the practices and communications
that lead to being respected.
     It’s a completely different goal that leads to completely
different results. (I am not motivated by you because I like
you; I am motivated by you because I respect you.)
     The core internal question that the leader returns to
is, If I were being managed by me, what would I most
need from my leader right now?
     The answer to that question varies, but most often is:
     1. The truth, as soon as you know the truth.
     2. Full and complete communication about
          what’s going on with me and with us.
     3. Keeping all promises, especially the small
          ones (I’ll get back to you by tomorrow
          with that) consistently, even fanatically.
          Not some promises, not a high percentage
          of promises, not a good college try, but all
          promises. When a promise cannot be kept
          (especially a small one), an immediate
          apology, update, and a new and better
          promise is issued.
84 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     A true leader does not try to become everybody’s big
buddy, although he or she values being upbeat and cheer-
ful in communication.
     A true leader is not overly concerned with always be-
ing liked, and is even willing to engage in very uncomfort-
able conversations in the name of being straight and
thorough. A true leader sees this aspect of leadership in
very serious, adult terms, and does not try to downplay
responsibility for leadership. True leaders do not try to
form inappropriate private friendships with members of
the team they are paid to lead. A true leader enjoys all the
elements of accountability and responsibility and trans-
forms performance measurement and management into
an above-board business adventure.


                          32. Do the Worst First
              The best way out is always through.
                                            —Robert Frost

    The number-one topic that leaders ask us to speak
about these days is: How do you motivate others when
you have poor time-management? This was true of Carlos,
who headed up a team of brokers.
    With everything that’s flying at me, everything that’s
coming in, all the calls that I get, all the obligations that I
have, I could really use another 10 hours in my day, Carlos
said.
    We laughed: This is true of everyone, Carlos. Stop
thinking you are unique. Re-program and bring yourself
into focus. Reboot your mind. Start over.
                                  Do the Worst First / 85

     All talented people in this global market have more to
do than they have time to do. That’s not really a problem.
It’s an exciting fact of life.
     But it’s very, very tempting to cave in to a sense of
being overwhelmed, Carlos said. It’s tempting to get into
that victim mindset of being ‘swamped.’
     True enough. So regroup and get the view from 30,000
feet. Rise up. Lift yourself up!
     But the truth is, I am swamped, Carlos almost yelled
out. There’s nothing I can do. I’m overwhelmed. How
can anyone manage this team when you’ve got all this stuff
going on? And right when you think you’re getting ahead
of it, you get a call, you get an e-mail, you get another
request, there’s another program that has to be imple-
mented, there’s another form that has to be filled out, and
I’m about to throw up my hands and say, ‘How do I do
this?’
     Carlos, listen. Get a grip for now. The simplest sys-
tem that you can come up with for time management will
serve you as a leader. Keep it simple.
     Why does it have to be simple? Carlos asked. It
seems like I need a more complex solution to a complex
set of challenges.
     Because no matter what you do, you can’t stop this
one truth about leadership: You are going to be hounded,
you’re going to be barraged, and you’re going to be inter-
rupted. And there are two reactions you can choose be-
tween to address this leadership fact of life.
     Carlos said nothing.
     You could just become a victim and say, ‘I can’t handle
it, there’s just too much to do.’ That takes no imagination,
it takes no courage, and it’s simply the easiest way to go—
86 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

to complain about your situation. Maybe even complain
to other people, other leaders, other managers, other fam-
ily members; they will all sympathize with you and might
even say, ‘You’ve got to get out of that business.’
     Carlos started nodding in agreement.
     That happens, Carlos said. But that doesn’t help
me enjoy my job: to have friends and family feeding back
to me that I ought to get out of the business. That makes it
twice as hard.
     Right! So there’s another way to go, and this is by
keeping the simplest time-management system possible in
your life. This is the one that we recommend, and it’s the
one that most leaders have had the most luck with. It’s so
simple, you can boil it down to two words, if you have to.
The words are these: worst first!
     Worst first?
     Exactly. Write it down!
     We worked with Carlos for a long time to get him to
see that the best way to manage his time was not to think
of it as managing time, but to think of it as managing pri-
orities. Because he can’t really manage time. He can’t
add any more time to his day.
     But he can manage the priorities and the things that
he chooses to do.
     Worst first, Carlos said. Explain it again. What does
it mean?
     Write down on a piece of paper all the things you’d
like to do in the upcoming day, Carlos. Maybe you were
jotting them down last night, but these are all things that
you know that you would like to do. The list doesn’t have
to be perfect. It can be all kinds of shorthand, and little
                                  Do the Worst First / 87

pictures and drawings, all over a scratched-up piece of
paper. Then you choose, among all these things, the one
thing that’s the most challenging and important. The one
thing you wish you didn’t have to do.
     How do I know for sure what that is? And how will
this, in the long run, improve the motivation of my people?
Isn’t that your area of specialty?
     Yes it is, but until you get this down, you won’t moti-
vate anyone. You have to have a secure place to come
from. An organized place inside yourself.
     Okay, okay, I know that, but how do I choose the
one thing to focus on?
     What is that one thing that you’re most likely to put
off? What’s your most important thing to do, the thing
that really needs to be done; not necessarily the most ur-
gent thing, but the most important?
     Oh, said Carlos, I think I’m seeing this. That thing
that pains me most to think of. That’s what I select to do
first.
     That’s it.
     Most managers are like Carlos. They don’t have a
simple system. They just respond to whatever’s most ur-
gent. All day they wonder, What has to be addressed right
now? And a lot of time, the urgent little things that come
up as an answer to that question are really small. They’re
nitpicky things, just hassles.
     But don’t the little things have to be done? Carlos
asked.
     Yeah, they have to be done, but in the meantime
you’re leaving important things behind. Many times, it is
even more effective to turn off your phones, get away from
88 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

your e-mail, select something that’s important, and do that
until it’s complete, and let the urgent go hang.
     I do know that there’s always something that eats at
the back of my mind, Carlos said. It keeps coming up, I
keep thinking about it. It gets in the way of the things I’m
doing.
     Now you’re on the right track, Carlos! You can’t fo-
cus in a relaxed and cheerful way on the things you are
doing because in the back of your mind, this important
thing is there. When you go home at night, the thing that
makes you the most weary, the most under-the-weather,
and most gives you the sense of not having had a good day,
is that one thing you didn’t do, but wish you had.
     Right. Boy do I know.
     So this is what you want to get into the category of
Worst First: You want to pick that one thing that’s hard-
est to do, that you would love to have finished and behind
you. You want to make it number one. First priority. Noth-
ing gets done until that gets done.
     Weeks went by, and Carlos struggled with the system,
but finally warmed up to it after a lot of practice. After
Carlos had finally made the worst first system into a
habit, he felt a freedom he never felt before. People around
him were inspired by how liberated he was becoming ev-
ery day from having done the hardest thing first. Carlos
would handle his biggest thing as his first thing, and then
live like the rest of the day was a piece of cake. His energy
soared. Soon he was teaching others the same system.
     He called a few months later to give an update on his
newly centered life in leadership.
     I am really freed up by this, Carlos said. If some-
one says to me, ‘Will you sit down and talk to me about
                                 Learn to Experiment / 89

this issue?’ and I have done my worst thing already, I can
say ‘Sure, how much time do you need? Let’s talk.’


                     33. Learn to Experiment
Don’t be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an
    experiment. The more experiments you make, the better.
                                     —Ralph Waldo Emerson

     One of the most common complaints of today’s ex-
ecutives is this: The people that they supervise hate to
make changes though they are constantly being required
to in this highly competitive business environment. The
executives then tear out their hair trying to get the needed
changes accomplished.
     The way we respond is that it may feel difficult to en-
courage people to change. But try this possibility: People
may not like to change, but they do love to experiment!
     As business consultant and journalist Dale Dauten has
observed, Experimentation never fails. When you try
something and it turns out to be a lousy idea, you never
really go back to where you started. You learned some-
thing. If nothing else, it makes you appreciate what you
were doing before. So I think it’s true that experiments
never fail.
     So in the businesses that we coach, there are never
any changes. However, our clients’ businesses are con-
stantly experimenting to find what works better for the
employees, the business, and the customer. The execu-
tives simply tell their teams, This is an experiment to see
if it works better for you and our customers. If it does,
90 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

great, we are going to continue doing it. If it doesn’t, then
we will modify it or get rid of it.
    And as long as you monitor it and get feedback, you’ll
find that the old-fashioned resistance to change melts away
because your employees really do enjoy a good experiment.


         34. Communicate Consciously
         Drowning in data, yet starved of information.
                 —Ruth Stanat, Global Business Consultant

     We live in the information age. Your people use their
minds creatively and productively throughout the day. They
aren’t just digging tunnels; they all communicate for a living.
     Now, more than ever before, communication is their
lifeblood. It is the lifeblood of every organization. Yet many
organizations leave most of their communication to chance,
to common sense, or to old traditions that no longer
function to keep everyone informed and included.
     Communication is the source of trust and respect
within each organization, so let’s put all our cards on the
table as often as possible.
     When we increase our awareness of communication, com-
munication is enhanced. When we take full responsibility
for how we communicate, the organization is enhanced.
     Leadership authority Warren Bennis says, Good lead-
ers make their people see they are at the very heart of things,
not at the periphery. Everyone feels that he or she makes a
difference to the success of the organization. When that hap-
pens people feel centered and that gives their work meaning.
                           Score the Performance / 91

               35. Score the Performance
      Performance is your reality. Forget everything else.
                               —Harold Geneen, CEO, ITT

    Can you imagine playing a game in which you don’t
know how it’s scored? Or competing in front of judges
when you don’t know their criteria? And the judges are
not going to tell you for a long time how you did? That
would be an athlete’s nightmare.
    We sat in a meeting run by Megan who was having a
hard time motivating her team to hit the company’s ex-
pected goals.
    Exactly how are we doing right now? her team mem-
ber Clarence asked Megan from the end of the round table
around which we were all sitting for the team meeting.
    Oh, I don’t know, Clarence, said Megan. I haven’t
looked at the printout yet. I have a sense that we are doing
pretty well this month, but I haven’t gotten to the num-
bers yet.
    You could see the look on Clarence’s face. It was a
cross between disappointment and pain.
    Later, we met with Megan alone and explained to her
why she needed to change her approach immediately if
she had any hope of motivating Clarence and his team-
mates. She had to know the score.
    I just don’t enjoy numbers, Megan said. I never
have. I’m not a numbers kind of person.
    Whether you enjoy numbers or not, if you’re in a
leadership position, it is imperative to be the numbers per-
son for your team. There’s no way you’re going to have a
92 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

motivated team here, Megan, until you do your homework,
put the numbers in front of you, and talk about those num-
bers when you talk to your people. If you’re their coach,
and you are, then you talk about the game and the score.
     Well, I played a little basketball in high school, Megan
said. Maybe I can relate it to that.
     Imagine your basketball coach during a game. Your
team comes to the sideline, it’s late in the game, and your
coach says, ‘Now I haven’t looked at the scoreboard for a
while, so I don’t know how many points we’re down, or
are we up? Anyway, here are some plays that I think we
ought to run after the time-out.’
     Megan smiled and said, That would be a coach that I
wouldn’t have any confidence in whatsoever!
     Why not, Megan?
     Megan said nothing.
     Aren’t you that coach, Megan?
     Megan said, I think I see what you mean. My best
coaches were people who rewarded numbers and got
excited.
     Right! Great leaders are the same. They are leaders
who call team members and say, ‘Hey, I just got your num-
bers for last week. Wow, that’s better than you’ve done all
year!’ These are the leaders people love to follow, because
they always know whether they are winning or losing. They
always know the score.
     We reminded Megan that earlier in her team meeting
she had said to her group, Well, you guys are really try-
ing hard and I know you are making the effort. I drove by
last night and I saw your lights on late, so I really admire
what you guys are doing. You’re really giving it the old
                          Score the Performance / 93

college try. We told her that she might be on the wrong
course with that approach.
    What was wrong with saying that? Megan asked.
    It’s wrong because respect for achievement is replaced
by respect for ‘trying.’ Megan, listen, we have a phrase in
our society’s language that sums it up. When someone is
willfully obtuse and ineffective, we say that person doesn’t
‘know the score.’ Why? Because ‘knowing the score’ is
the first step in all achievement.
    What we wanted Megan to see was that this mistake
of hers was immediately correctable. It was only the mis-
take of not looking over some numbers before sending
an e-mail or making a call.
    But that one little mistake will give her team the im-
pression that they’re here for reasons other than winning
and achieving precise goals.
    The coach has to be the one to explain to the team
with tremendous precision exactly what the score is, ex-
actly how much time is left, and exactly how the strategy is
based on those numbers. When you have a numbers-based
team, you know when you are winning, you know when
you’ve had a good day, you know when you’re having a
good run, and you know when you are not.
    That creates a wonderful sense that there is no hidden
agenda from this leader. So look for ways, as you commu-
nicate with your people, to improve and increase the way
they are measured and, especially, to increase the con-
sciousness of that measurement.
    But it has to come from you. You can’t wait around
for the company policy to shift. That’s what most people
do. They wait for their own management to come up with
some kind of new system, new scorebooks, new posters,
94 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

something like that. But don’t do that. Don’t wait. Have it
come from you.
    It has to be your personal innovation to find more ways
to keep score. That way, people will link it to you and
know how much it means to you. Is there anything that
you want improved? Find ways to track it, to keep score.
The love of games that is in every human being is some-
thing that you can tap into. The more you measure things,
the more motivated your people are to win those games.

                              Fundamentals First
Show me a man who cannot bother to do little things and I’ll show
       you a man who cannot be trusted to do big things.
                 —Lawrence D. Bell, Founder, Bell Aircraft

    The Rodney Mercado motivational methods are not
only the most effective methods for teaching music, but
for anything else.
    Professor Mercado was a genius in 10 different fields,
including mathematics, economics, sociology, anthropol-
ogy, and music history.
    Scott recalls: Once, I was surprised to be getting an
economics lesson inside my music lesson. Mercado turned
to me and said, Well, Scott, you know, math is very, very
simple. It’s all based on addition. But most people lose
sight of that. So if you learn how to do one plus one equals
two, everything in math flows from that. Everything.
    He was always focusing on fundamentals.
               Manage the Fundamentals First / 95

    Like the time he came to assist our chamber group in
preparing to perform a piece. Under his guidance, we
spent the entire hour working on the first two measures
of this piece. We kept going over and over them, and
each time he would ask us to explore a new possibility.
    How would you like to create more sound here? he
would ask. And then he would give us ideas on how we
could possibly do that. And by the end of the hour, all we
had done was work on two measures of a piece that prob-
ably had 80 measures of music. Then, at the very end, he
said, Okay, now let’s play the whole thing.
    The entire performance and our entire group were
transformed. We played the whole thing beautifully!
    That showed me the power of fundamentals. Don’t
gloss over them. Slow your people down and do things
step by step, getting the basics right, getting the funda-
mentals in place.
    We were coaching a client recently in his company-
wide managers’ meeting, and two people didn’t show up
on time for the meeting. The CEO wanted to rush through
the meeting and talk to the people who didn’t show up
later.
    But we slowed him down and had the whole group
focus, slowly and fundamentally, on how to handle this
tardiness and absenteeism and lack of commitment from
these two managers. In the process, we had a number of
breakthrough moments for other managers on the na-
ture of commitment, and a newer, more creative policy
emerged.
96 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

                         37. Motivate by Doing
People can be divided into two classes: those who go ahead and do
      something, and those people who sit still and inquire,
               why wasn’t it done the other way?
                                   —Oliver Wendell Holmes

     Most managers don’t do things according to priority—
they do things according to feelings. That’s how their day
is run. (This, by the way, is exactly how infants live. They
live from feeling to feeling. Do they feel like crying? Do
they feel like laughing? Do they feel like drooling? That’s
an infant’s life.)
     Professional managers fall into two categories: doers
and feelers.
     Doers do what needs to be done to reach a goal that
they themselves have set. They come to work having al-
ready planned out what needs to be done.
     Feelers, on the other hand, do what they feel like do-
ing. Feelers take their emotional temperature through-
out the day, checking in on themselves, figuring out what
they feel like doing right now. Their lives, their outcomes,
their financial security are all dictated by the fluctua-
tion of their feelings. Their feelings will change con-
stantly, of course, so it’s hard for a feeler to follow anything
through to a successful conclusion. Their feelings are
changed by many things: biorhythms, gastric upset, a strong
cup of coffee, an annoying call from home, a rude waitress
at lunch, a cold, a bit of a headache, a thought. Those are
the dictating forces, the commanders, of a feeler’s life.
                                 Motivate by Doing / 97

    A doer already knows in advance how much time will
be spent on the phone, how much in the field, what em-
ployees will be cultivated that day, what relationships will
be strengthened, what communications need to be made.
Doers use a three-step system to guarantee success:
    1. They figure out what they want to achieve.
    2. They figure out what needs to be done to
        achieve it.
    3. They do it.
     This is not a theory, this is the actual observed system
used by all super achievers without fail.
     A feeler is adrift in a mysterious life of unexpected
consequences and depressing problems. A feeler asks, Do
I feel like making my phone calls now? Do I feel like
writing that thank you note? Do I feel like dropping in
on that person right now? If the answer is no, then the
feeler keeps going down the list, asking, Do I feel like
doing something else?
     A feeler lives inside that line of inquiry all day long.
     By contrast, a doer has high self-esteem. A doer en-
joys many satisfactions throughout the day, even though
some of them were preceded by discomfort.
     A feeler is almost always trying to be comfortable, but
never really satisfied.
     A doer knows the true, deep joy that only life’s super
achievers know.
     A feeler believes that joy is for children, and that life
for an adult is an ongoing hassle.
     A doer experiences more and more power every year
of life.
98 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    A feeler feels less and less powerful as the years go on.
    Your ability to motivate others increases exponentially
as your reputation as a doer increases. You also get more
and more clarity about who the doers and feelers are on
your own team. Then, as you model and reward the doing,
you also begin to inspire the feelers on your team to be-
come doers.


    38. Know Your People’s Strengths
        Those few who use their strengths to incorporate
         their weaknesses, who don’t divide themselves,
       those people are very rare. In any generation there
            are a few and they lead their generation.
                         —Moshe Feldenkrais, Psychologist

    Know your people’s strengths.
    It’s the fundamental business insight that inspired the
book Good to Great by Jim Collins (HarperBusiness, 2001).
And this idea of going from good to great also applies to
the people you motivate. It’s far more effective to build
on their strengths than to worry too much about their
weaknesses. The first step is to really know their strengths
so you can help them to express them even more.
    Most managers spend way too much time, especially
in the world of sales, trying to fix what’s wrong.
    Your people may identify negative things and say, Oh,
I’m not good at this. I need to change that. And I’m not
very good on the phone. I need to fix that.... But listen to
their voice tones when they say these things! They’ll always
sound depressed and world-weary.
                   Know Your People’s Strengths / 99

     Here’s the simple formula (and once we recognize this
formula, we can do some wonderful things): If people fo-
cus on what’s wrong with them, just focusing on that puts
them in a bad mood. People grimly, glumly, confront with
a kind of morbid honesty, what’s wrong. And the voice
tones go down, because the enthusiasm goes down, and
the dreariness sets in. And pretty soon, they’re putting off
activities. They’re procrastinating. They’re saying, This
makes me uncomfortable. I don’t even like thinking about
this right now. For some reason (I don’t know why, I was
in a good mood before I started...), I’m not in the mood to
work on this. I can tell that I can’t work on this problem
until I feel a little more energy. I mean, you can’t work on
something when there’s no energy to work.
     We went into a computer company and listened as the
manager, Matt, talked about his team.
     I wish my salespeople would do more research be-
fore their sales calls, Matt said.
     And then when we sat down with one of Matt’s sales-
people, Byron, he said, Yeah, that’s something I’m not
very good at.
     Okay, you’re not very good at that. So let’s move on.
     No, no, I need to fix that, said Byron. That’s some-
thing that needs to be fixed. I need to get better. Why
don’t you coach me? How do I get better at that?
     And we could hear his low voice tone. We knew Byron
would never get better at that because of the negative
mindset the very subject put him in.
     To really take something on and to grow and strengthen
it, people need to be in an upbeat, positive mood. People
need to have energy. That’s when they’re at their best.
100 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     So, when will my people have energy? manager Matt
asked us after we explained the concept of moods to him.
     They get energy when they think about the things
they’re really good at in sales. Have them ask themselves,
‘What am I really good at? What are my strengths?’ The
minute they start focusing on those things, their energy
will pick up. Their self-esteem will pick up. Their enthusi-
asm will pick up.
     That’s where the fastest infusion of productivity al-
ways comes from. First, you find what this person is good
at, and then you move good to great.
     When we worked with Matt’s salesperson Byron, we
said, Okay, Byron, forget about your weaknesses, forget
about what you’re not good at. That’s probably all you’ve
been thinking about for a few months, right?
     Right, said Byron. You know, my manager coun-
sels me on it. I’ve had things written up about it. I’ve been
given activities to do to correct it. But the problem is, I
just go deeper, and I don’t produce.
     Listen, Byron, set those activities aside. Forget about
all the problems that need to be fixed. We’re not going to
fix anything for now. We want an infusion, we want a stimu-
lus. We want a burst of sales to take you out of the cellar
and put you up there where you belong in the upper
rankings of the salespeople. Later, when we have the luxury,
and we’re bored, and we can’t figure out what to do in
coaching sessions, we may take a weakness and play around
with it, for the pure fun of it. But for now, we’re not going
to do it. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to
acknowledge one thing: You’re not going to be great at any-
thing until you enjoy it. We want to find out what you’re
already good at, and we want to build on that.
                   Know Your People’s Strengths / 101

     Well, one of my strengths is in-person, said Byron.
I love to be in-person. I’m bad on the phone, I’m bad
with faxes, I’m bad with e-mail. But in-person, I can just
close deals, I can talk, I can expand, I can upsell, I can
cross-sell....
     Okay, great. So rather than fix the phone thing and
fix the e-mail thing, let’s leave those aside for the moment.
Only use them if you must to get an appointment. Don’t
use them to sell anything. We want to increase what you’re
good at. Get out there, sit with people. Keep increasing
that and get even better at it. Don’t say ‘I’m already good
at it, and that’s that.’ Of course you’re good at it. But the
way you’re going to be really tremendous in this field is to
turn good into great, to get great at that thing, because
you’re more than two-thirds of the way there. Because
you’re already good at it.
     What we wanted to steer Byron away from is this
thought: Well, I’m already good at it, that’s sort of natu-
ral, that comes easy to me. That’s sort of cheating when I
do a lot of that. What I really need to do is work at what
I’m bad at.
     To be great motivators, we need to look at human be-
havior differently. We’ve been taught the wrong way since
we were young! If we got an A in science, but we flunked
English, our parents said, Hey, I don’t care about your
other grades, what you really need to do is work hard on
your English, because you flunked it. So you’re going to
focus your life on English for a while.
     All of our lives, we’ve been taught that the way to suc-
ceed is to take something that you’re not good at and
change it. Take your weaknesses and spend time with them
so that you can bring your weaknesses up to normal.
102 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Do you know how little an effect it has on someone’s
productivity if they take their weaknesses and work hard
and finally bring them from subnormal to normal?
     All throughout life we’ve been taught that when we’re
good at something, it just means it’s innate. Our parents
say, Oh, he’s really good at the piano. He must have got-
ten that from his grandfather, he must have inherited that,
he’s got a natural talent at that. So we’re taught not to
focus on it. We’re taught that that will be okay by itself.
People tell us, You really need to put your attention on
all the things you’re bad at!
     Jennifer was on a sales staff we were coaching, and
she was kind of intimidated because the sales staff had a
lot of flashy, good-looking, well-dressed fraternity-type
guys and sorority-type girls on it. Jennifer was more of a
shy person. She was very bright and very compassionate,
but she just couldn’t make herself do things the way the
other salespeople did. And so she was frustrated, and all
she tried to do was work on her weaknesses, and when-
ever we met her, she would bring in this long list of things
she wasn’t any good at.
     These are the things I want to talk about, Jennifer
said. These are the top seven things I’m terrible at.
     Throw that list out.
     What?
     We don’t care about that list. We really don’t. You
wouldn’t be here if you didn’t have the basic skills to be
here. So stop it. Here’s what we’d like you to do. Think
back for a little while. Think about your life. When were
you really happy? If you can look back and get in touch
with moments in your life when you were really happy, it’s
going to give us some clues about where to go from here.
                   Know Your People’s Strengths / 103

    Well, I was a waitress not too long ago, before I came
here, Jennifer said. There was a restaurant that I worked
in that, originally, I didn’t like, but finally just loved. I
really enjoyed it. It was like I was in heaven, I just got so
good at it. I was serving customers and I was taking their
orders and I got the biggest tips of anybody there. It was
just wonderful. It felt like a dance, it felt like a musical.
And also, the money coming in to me was greater than
anyone else there.
    We’ve hit on something here!
    Well, I can’t do that, Jennifer said. I’ve got bills to
pay, I’ve got kids. I can’t go back to that. There’s not
enough money there, no matter how good you are. I’ve
got to do this. I’ve got to get the big accounts. I’ve got to
get the big commissions I know I can make.
    So we’re going to do that. But we’re not going to do it
from being a back-slapping, flashy salesperson. We’re go-
ing to go with your strength.
    Well, my strength is waiting on tables and serving
people.
    Yes! So that’s what you’re going to do. That’s who
you’re going to be. You’re going to serve. You’re going
to take orders. You’re going to present menus. You’re
going to explain what the dishes are like. You’re going
to ask clients what they like. You’re going to give them
options, and that same person you were in the restau-
rant, you’re going to be in this selling situation. You’re
going to tap into that same love of serving and present-
ing options, and fulfilling orders. That’s going to be who
you are, but you’re going to do it in this context, selling
this product. And when you get on the phone, you’re
going to be that way, you’re going to be the person who
104 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

wants to know how you can help. Not a salesperson.
Not a salesperson at all. You will use all the words you
used when you were a happy waitress. ‘You’re not quite
ready? I’d be glad to come back. Take your time. I want
you to know what’s here. I want you to know what the
specials are, so you can make your decision.’ And come
from that point of view. That’s who you are. That’s a
way of being that you loved being. And you can be that
here. You can serve rather than sell, and it will work
for you.
    Two or three months later, Jennifer was doing ex-
tremely well. She had made a remarkable breakthrough.
She came at the whole job from a completely different
place. She took what she loved to do the most, and she did
that all day. She took what she already knew she was good
at, she took a strength, and she moved it from good to
great.

                                                —Talleyrand

    All it might take is half a day to catch everything up,
sort everything out, clean everything away, and be ready
to begin next week with a whole new lease on life, staying
organized as you go.
    But still you resist.
                                   Debate Yourself / 105

    You know you will never find time to do that half a
day of reorganization. Therefore, you must make time.
Winners make time to do what’s really beneficial and im-
portant to them. Losers keep trying to find time.
    When you hear a pessimistic manager say, I’m sorry
I didn’t get back to you, Dave. I was swamped yesterday,
that swamped feeling has become reality.
    But being swamped is just an interpretation. If that
manager was locked in solitary confinement for five years,
and somebody offered him this job where they had a lot of
phone calls and things to do, would they call it being
swamped? They would call it being wonderfully busy. They
would call it absolute heaven.
    So which is it? Swamped or busy?
    A woman in one of our workshops a year ago said,
My job is a total nightmare. It is hell on earth. The fact
that I even show up for it is surprising to me—it is an
absolute nightmare.
    What is the nightmare?
    Well, I’ve got people calling in, I’ve got two different
bosses telling me what to do. I’ve got an in-box stacked
like this high, and I go home from work stressed out.
    Okay, what if we were to introduce you to a woman
from Rwanda whose husband has been dead for two years
and who has had to eat out of garbage cans to live, do you
think you could persuade her that your job is a nightmare?
Would she like trading lives with you? Would your job be
a nightmare to that woman?
    Oh, no, not to her it wouldn’t be a nightmare. It would
be the greatest blessing.
    So, is your job a nightmare? A nightmare is only a
nightmare in your own thinking. It’s a perception. You
106 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

can choose another if you want. You can choose another
job, or you can choose another perception. You are free.
    Be willing to teach your people how to debate them-
selves. Forget that it’s supposed to be a sign of insanity to
be talking to yourself. Because the truth is that when we
question our own thinking, we start to elevate to new lev-
els of thinking. We start to really accomplish things if we
have enough courage to question our own thinking. Here
are some questions we might want to ask ourselves, for
beginners: Is that really true? Is my manager really out
to get me? Is this really happening? Is this really a bad
opportunity? It might be, but is it really? What else could
I say about it? What would be a more useful way to inter-
pret it? We can teach people to question everything they
have labeled as negative.
    Be ruthless with yourself, too, as you debate the chaos
that builds up in your life. Simplify your life to feel your
full power. When Vince Lombardi was asked why his
world-champion football team had the simplest offensive
system in all of football, his response was, It’s hard to be
aggressive when you’re confused.


                   40. Lead With Language
     The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality.
                —Max DePree, Business Consultant/Author

    We once worked with a group of managers who man-
aged various teams in a company plagued with low mo-
rale. The teams were grumbling, and exulting in victim
language.
                             Lead With Language / 107

    But once we suggested different words and language
for the managers to use in team meetings, everything be-
gan to change. Their people became more self-motivated.
    As the psychological turnaround advanced, the man-
agers began to open their meetings by asking who had an
acknowledgment—Who would like to acknowledge some-
one else right now?—and the talk began to swing to ap-
preciation, instead of to complaint and criticism. And all
of a sudden, the mood of the meetings changed.
    Instead of focusing on problems, and getting stuck there,
the leaders would learn to say, What opportunities do you
see? And just by saying that enough times, a different kind
of energy would emerge. Different than the low-morale days
when the leaders used to say, What are the problems? What
do we have to get through? Who’s to blame?
    When managers asked, What can we get from this?
results changed faster.
    We had a tough week last week. Let’s go around the
table. What can we learn from that? What are some new
systems we might put in? If that comes up again, what
would be a great way of dealing with it? How can we have
fun with this in the future?
    The managers got the victim language out of their sys-
tems. They got stronger by using, What do we want?
What’s our intention? What’s our goal? What outcome
would we love to see? Every time victim language was
replaced by the language of intention, different results
occurred. Some of the most dramatic results:
    1. Turnover decreased.
    2. Absenteeism decreased.
    3. Spirit and morale improved.
    4. Productivity increased.
108 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     And all that happened with language.
     Words mean things. Words that form thoughts create
things. Ancient scriptures say, In the beginning, there
was the word. And there’s a lot of modern-day truth to
that. Words start things going. Change a single word in
what you say, and you can scare a child. One scary word
can make a child shake and cry. Change that word back,
and the child is fine. Words communicate pictures, en-
ergy, emotions, possibilities, and fears.
     Words can scare an employee, too.
     Sometimes victims try to be leaders, but can’t. That’s
because they think they ought to do it. But the leadership
spirit is not accessed that way. It’s a graceful spirit, not a
heavy burden.
     This type of language won’t get you there: I should
be more of a leader.
     Any time a victim finds out about leadership language,
and then says, You know, I really should be more of a
leader, that’s simply more victim language! That drives
the person deeper down into victim feelings.
     Why should you be more of a leader?
     Well, I guess people would like me more. They would
approve of me more.
     Who cares what other people think? What do you want?
     Leadership is based on personal, internal intention.
It’s living a life that has clarity of purpose at the center of
it. Victimization is not based on intention. Victimization
is based on being a victim of circumstance and other
people’s opinion. The victim is constantly obsessed with
what other people think.
                       Use Positive Reinforcement / 109

     Well, what would my wife think if I did that? What
would my kids think? What would my boss think? What
would the people think if they saw me singing in my car? If
a person pulls up next to me, what’s he gonna think?
     Obsessing about what other people think throughout
the day is the fastest way to lose your enthusiasm for life.
It’s the fastest way to lose that basic energy that gets ev-
erything done that you’ve ever been proud of. You notice
that children don’t seem to have that worry. Most chil-
dren, when they’re in the middle of something they really
love, seem to forget that anybody is watching them, and
even forget that there’s a world out there. They just get
swept away. Good leaders do the same thing.


                                     41. Use Positive
                                      Reinforcement
      The first duty of a leader is optimism. How does your
 subordinate feel after meeting with you? Does he feel uplifted?
                    If not, you are not a leader.
                              —Field Marshall Montgomery

    Nobody remembers it. Everybody seems to forget it.
But positive reinforcement trumps negative criticism ev-
ery time.
    It doesn’t matter if you are training dolphins or moti-
vating your team members, positive reinforcement is the
way to go. You don’t see trainers at Sea World beating the
dolphins with baseball bats when they don’t jump through
the right hoops. You see them, instead, giving them little
fish when they do jump through.
110 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Why can’t we remember that?
     We’re too busy chasing down problems and then criti-
cizing the problematic people who created the problems.
That’s how most managers lead.
     But that’s a habit trap. And like any other habit trap,
there are certain small behaviors that will remove you from
that trap. For example, you will want to pause a moment
before e-mailing or calling any one of your team players.
You will want to take a moment. You want to decide what
small appreciation you can communicate to them.
     You will want to always realize that positive reinforce-
ment is powerful when it comes to guiding and shaping
human performance. This revelation continues to surprise
us, because we have been trained by our society to iden-
tify what’s wrong and fix it.
     There’s a better way: Find out what’s right and reward it.
     A very surprised Napoleon once said, The most amaz-
ing thing I have learned about war is that men will die for
ribbons.


                       42. Teach Your People
                                  No Power
             As we look ahead into the next century,
           leaders will be those who empower others.
                                              —Bill Gates

    The tragedy of a disempowered, weak-willed life ex-
tends to all aspects of work.
                    Teach Your People No Power / 111

     Unless you change it.
     Tina reports to you. And one of the things she reports
to you is that she is stressed out and incapable of doing all
of her work.
     After a long talk about her life on the job, it becomes
clear that Tina has no goals, plans, or commitments. It is
no wonder, therefore, that Tina allows people to waste
her time. People that Tina doesn’t even care about keep
taking up her time. She can’t say no to them only because
she hasn’t said yes to anything else.
     You talk to her.
     The greatest value of planning and goal-setting is that
it gives you your own life to live. It puts you back in charge.
It allows you to focus on what’s most important to you. So
you won’t walk around all week singing the Broadway song,
‘I’m Just A Girl Who Can’t Say No.’
     You begin to sing that song to her. She begs you to
stop.
     Okay, how do I turn it around? Tina asks you. How
do I learn to say no?
     Ask yourself these questions: ‘What goals are most
important to me? And how much time do I give them?
What people are most important to me? And how much
time do I give them?’
     We hear many complaints from people in business who
are going through the same kind of scattered lives. It’s as
if they’re dying from a thousand tiny distractions. They
report a life of being constantly drained by other people’s
requests. People poking their heads in all day saying, Gotta
minute? Gotta minute?
112 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Slam the door on those poking heads. Those incessant
talking heads give you a life in which you have not learned
to say no.
     Once you learn it, teach it to your people, too. Make it
an honorable thing.
     Your people’s access to focused work will depend on
their willingness to develop a little-used muscle that we
call the No Muscle. If they never use this muscle, it won’t
perform for them when the chips are down. It will be too
weak to work. Any request by any coworker or relative
will pull them from the mission.
     The key to teaching your people to develop the No
Muscle is to first develop their Yes Muscle. If they will
say yes to the things that are important to them, then say-
ing no to what’s not important will get easier and easier.
Help them verbalize what they want. Make them say it out
loud.
     Tina, you need to know what you want, know it in
advance, and chances are you’ll get it. It’s easy to say no to
something if you’ve already said yes to something better.


                         43. Keep Your People
                              Thinking Friendly
                           Customer Thoughts
              There is only one boss: the customer.
                                              —Sam Walton

    Our customers are the origin, the originating source,
of all the money we have and all the things we own. It’s not
 Keep Your People Thinking Friendly...Thoughts / 113

the company that pays us, it’s the customer. The company
just passes the customer’s money along to us.
     When we take a vacation, it’s important to realize that
the customer has paid for it. When we send a child to col-
lege, it’s with our customer’s money!
     Sam Walton built his Wal-Mart empire knowing that
there was always only one boss: the customer. He believes
that the customer has the power to fire everyone in the
company simply by spending his money somewhere else.
     Why not begin motivating our people accordingly? Why
not show our people the joy of treating that customer re-
lationship as a real and genuine friendship? It could be, in
the end, our ultimate competitive advantage.
     Without our encouragement as leaders, the customer
tends to fall off the radar screen. Without our asking the
provocative and respectfully encouraging questions of our
people, the customer can even become a hassle, or a
necessary evil in our lives.
     In our zeal to bond with the people who report to us,
we all too often commiserate and sympathize with their
horror stories about how hard it is to please customers,
how customers take advantage of us, why the phone ring-
ing all day is such a problem for time management...and
we agree, and by agreeing, we unknowingly plant the seeds
that allow customers to be treated coldly, stupidly, and in
a very unfriendly way.
     And this defeats the whole purpose of business! We’re
even willing to go farther: poor customer relations becomes
the root cause of every business problem we have.
     Notice, if you will, how you are treated by the airlines
that are having the biggest financial difficulties and how
you are (almost always—no one’s perfect, yet) treated by
114 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

the people at Southwest Airlines, the only highly profit-
able airline. It is no accident that Southwest is the only
airline that devotes all its thinking to the problems of the
customer while the other airlines devote all of their think-
ing to the problems of the airline.
     The whole purpose of your business is to take such
good care of the customer that the customer makes it a
habit of returning to your business and buying more and
more every time.
     But this will only happen when your people consciously
build relationships with your customers. When they ac-
tively, consciously, creatively, cleverly, strategically, art-
fully, and gently build the relationship with the customer.
Building the relationship does not come easy. It goes against
our deepest habits.
     And it will never happen if your people see the cus-
tomer as a hassle...someone on the phone checking out
prices...just an annoyance...someone interrupting me when
I was just about to go to lunch...just a problem in my
day...someone trying to return something...someone try-
ing to challenge my years of expertise...some jerk...some
idiot....
     The reason this kind of disrespect and even contempt
for the customer sinks into the psyche of our people is a
lack of ongoing encouragement to think any other way. In
other words, a lack of leadership. In other words, you and
me. A bad attitude toward the customer always comes, in
some subtle way, from the top.
     A fish rots from the head down.
     We as leaders set the tone. We either ask the right
questions that start the ball rolling in our employees’ minds,
or we do not. If I am a leader, I want to ask questions that
 Keep Your People Thinking Friendly...Thoughts / 115

respect my people’s intelligence. I want to treat them as if
they are master psychologists, as if they are experts in cus-
tomer behavior and customer thinking patterns—because
they are. I want to ask how we can build more trust with
the customer. I want to ask how we can convert a seem-
ingly simple phone call into a warm relationship that leads
to the customer liking us and wanting to buy from us no
matter what the price is. I want to ask how we can get the
sales force to win the customer’s trust and repeat busi-
ness. I want to ask for advice and help with the psychology
of the customer. I want to ask the questions that will mo-
tivate my own managers to start thinking in terms of life-
time customers instead of single transactions.
    I might start a meeting with my team by saying, Let’s
say you’re a potential customer and you’re calling my store.
Let’s say you’re new in town and have no buying habits yet
in this category of product. I’m the third store you have
called. If I’m stressed and grumpy, and I simply give you
the price you wanted for a product you’re curious about
and hang up, I may have lost you forever. What does that
matter? A loss of a $69 won’t kill us!
    But consider the lifetime impact—or even just the
next 10 years. What if that customer spends even just $400
a year in this category but has, because of this bad original
call with us, formed a buying habit with a competitor?
(Most people go to certain stores because it feels com-
fortable to go there.) In 10 years, that customer would
have spent $4,000. That’s $4,000 lost in less than a minute
on a bad phone call. If someone lost $4,000 in one minute
from the cash register, would they still be working for us?
    Finally, in the end, I don’t want to be too macho or
too professional or too afraid of what people would think
116 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

of me if I even used the word friend once in a while in
my questions about how we can treat customers better.
How would we treat that customer if that person were a
dear friend?
    Why is the word friend so rarely heard in the world of
business relations? Are friends really better than cus-
tomers? Does your best friend regularly come by and give
you money to help with the mortgage payment? Does your
friend pull out his checkbook after having a beer with you
and say, Here’s a little something for your daughter’s
dental bill? No?
    Our customers do.


        44. Use Your Best Time for Your
                    Biggest Challenge
          It’s so hard when contemplated in advance,
                   and so easy when you do it.
                      —Robert Pirsig, Philosopher/Author

     It’s so important to use your best time for your big-
gest challenge.
     Of course you can’t always do this. Sometimes chal-
lenges have a way of blowing out their own hole in your
timetable. But whenever possible, see if you can match up
your prime biological (emotional, physical, mental) time
with the big job or big communications you have to do.
     Many leaders are at their best in the first hours of the
morning; others hit their prime in the late morning; others
still, in the late afternoon. Whichever is your best time to
                                  Use 10 Minutes Well / 117

shine, don’t waste it on trivia and low-return activities.
Invest that energy and peak attention into the big chal-
lenge you’ve been procrastinating about.
     Most of us confuse pleasure with happiness. We find
great pleasure in spending our highest-energy state on small
tasks, taking them out with relish and flair, blowing away
all these minor, little must-do’s with great bursts of en-
ergy and good cheer. But all the while, that big thing is
lurking, waiting until we’re tired and cranky to be fully
contemplated, which is why it gets put off so often.
     Know ahead of time what your biggest challenge is.
Set it up to be taken out with massive, unstoppable action
while you are at your most resourceful and energetic. You
do have a best time of day, mentally. Know when it is.
Then use it! The ultimate source of a leader’s professional
happiness is the feeling of accomplishment you get when
you take out the big thing!
     The look on your face alone will motivate others to
follow you.


                       45. Use 10 Minutes Well
Man must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind him to the
  fact that each moment of his life is a miracle and a mystery.
                                               —H.G. Wells

    Contemporary philosopher William Irwin was asked
what he thought the secret of effective leadership was. His
answer was, Learn to use 10 minutes intelligently. It will
pay you huge dividends.
118 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Often what separates a great leader from a lousy man-
ager is just that: the ability to use 10 minutes well.
     The Irwin quote is one that we have on our office wall,
reminding us that it really helps to have short, motivating
quotations posted in plain view. It is a way to wake your-
self up to your potential. Especially when you only have 10
minutes before your next appointment. Will you use it well?
Or will you kill time?
     Our recent visit to a very successful leader’s office
was enhanced by our noticing these words posted on the
wall behind his desk—also a great guideline for using 10
minutes well:
     The Most Important Words in the English Language
     5 most important words: I am proud of you!
     4 most important words: What is your opinion?
     3 most important words: If you please.
     2 most important words: Thank you.
     1 most important word: You.
     Here’s another quotation put up there on the office
wall. This one’s from Charles Buxton, the famous lawyer
and member of Parliament in the 1800s: You will never
‘find’ time for anything, if you want time you must make it.
     And sometimes that powerful leadership item we have
not found time to do can be made to fit into the next 10-
minute window.


     46. Know What You Want to Grow
  Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishments.
                         —Jim Rohn, Business Philosopher
                    Know What You Want to Grow / 119

     Most managers, especially those who struggle with
making plan, place the plan’s numbers down around sixth
on their daily priority list.
     Most struggling managers place these things above the
plan in their priority hierarchy:
     1. Not upsetting other people’s feelings.
     2. The commitment to looking extremely busy.
     3. Fire-fighting and problem-solving.
     4. Explaining and justifying other people’s
         performances, both up and down the
         ladder.
     5. Being liked.
     A few years ago we saw the brilliant business consult-
ant Steve Hardison come into a struggling, financially fail-
ing company and turn everything around. He did it by
altering priorities.
     The first thing he did was put HUGE whiteboards up
all over the company meeting room to record and reflect
daily sales numbers and activity.
     In the company’s past, numbers had been an embar-
rassment. They were whispered about at the end of the
month. If people weren’t hitting good numbers, the man-
agement spent all its time listening to the reasons.
     The salespeople became good salespeople, but what
they were learning to sell was their excuses, not their prod-
uct. All management meetings focused on Circumstances,
Issues, and Situations that Prevent Us from Succeeding.
     The other day, we spoke to an operations manager at a
company that was falling far short of its business projections.
     We’re not making plan, he said.
     Why not?
120 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     The economy. The weather. The war. The way kids
are brought up today. The lack of good candidates for
positions here. Company dysfunction. Industry decline.
Government regulations. Competition moving in. No bud-
get for sales training.
     Other than that, what’s in your way?
     As we sat in on their company meetings, we observed
that all the management meetings were about those sub-
jects. All their meetings focused on the obstacles to success.
     What you focus on grows.
     Focus on numbers, and they, too, will grow.
     Huge.


                           47. Soften Your Heart
He is only advancing in life whose heart is getting softer, his blood
warmer, his brain quicker, and his spirit entering into living peace.
                          —John Ruskin, Art and Social Critic

    People who really succeed in leadership and in sales
transform the entire activity away from the concept of
managing and selling (even though they have high re-
spect for that) into the day-to-day concept of building
relationships.
    They always think in terms of their relationship with
the other person: How can I make it better? How can I
serve her? How can I contribute to her life today? How
can I show him a demonstration of my commitment? How
can I make her happier? How can I make it easier for
him to access this information?
                Coach Your People to Complete / 121

    There is a continual expansion of the friendly side of
the relationship. A leader knows that communication solves
almost all problems. Avoidance worsens all problems.
    No leadership agreement was ever made outside of a
conversation. So have your conversations be vital.
    Have a lot of conversations today and make them warm
and comfortable. Have them all lead you to your ultimate
goal.
    Master teacher Lance Secretan has written 13 books
on leadership, and sums up his findings this way: Leader-
ship is not so much about technique and methods as it is
about opening the heart. Leadership is about inspiration—
of oneself and of others. Great leadership is about human
experiences, not processes. Leadership is not a formula
or a program, it is a human activity that comes from the
heart and considers the hearts of others.


                      48. Coach Your People
                                to Complete
         Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging
                  on of an uncompleted task.
                 —William James, Psychologist/Philosopher

     If your people become more and more burned out and
fatigued, it’s up to you to help them redirect a course of ac-
tion that leads them to the completion of previous projects.
     Once, long ago, we went to hear Cheryl Richardson
give a presentation to Coach U over in Phoenix, and it
was the first time we went to one of her meetings. We
122 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

didn’t know her or anything about Coach U, but we settled
in for the talk.
     Richardson stood up and said to all of us, Can you
come up with a list of the top 10 things that are incom-
plete, that need to get done in your life? Can you come up
with that list?
     Of course, everyone could. So we did. We all wrote 10
things down! And then she told us a story to illustrate how
she coaches her clients. She said she had a massage thera-
pist who came in to see her, and she said to him, What’s
the issue?
     And the client said, I need more business.
     She said, Okay, I want you to write down the top 10
unfinished things that you need to complete in your life.
And the client wrote them down.
     Then she said, Now, I want you to make a commit-
ment that you will get those complete.
     And the massage therapist said, Okay, but that’s not
why I’m here to see you. I’m here because I need more
business.
     Cheryl Richardson said, I know that. Get this done,
and you’ll get more business.
     And her coaching client said, What? This doesn’t have
anything to do with getting more business.
     Cheryl explained, Actually, everything that is incom-
plete in your life is what I call an energy drain. And that is
stopping you from creating more business.
     Well, that doesn’t make any sense to me.
     Cheryl said, I only do this for a living! I counsel lots
of clients, who all have this same thing. Are you willing to
try it? If not, let’s forget this relationship.
                  Do the Math on Your Approach / 123

     Well, okay, I guess, yeah. I need to get those things
done anyway. So he made a commitment to get three of
the 10 done by the next meeting.
     The following week, he reported back in and said, I
completed my assignment.
     And Cheryl asked, What happened?
     Amazing! Even before the first week was over, three
new people have called me out of the blue, and filled up
my calendar.
     And Cheryl says, That’s how it works.
     We never forgot that lesson, and have re-taught it ever
since. It’s not just that your people have got all those
incompletes out there, but the underlying thought of it,
the subconscious knowledge is the energy drain.
     It’s draining their productivity, imagination, and vital-
ity away. Help them clean up those incompletes and their
motivation will surprise you.


                             49. Do the Math on
                                 Your Approach
               We make a living by what we get,
              but we make a life by what we give.
                                       —Winston Churchill

    You will really enjoy motivating others if you start
thinking of your life as a mathematical equation.
    We first saw the fun and benefit of this when our good
friend and company CEO Duane Black solved the equation
on two flip charts in front of a grateful gathering of managers.
124 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Here it is: When you are positive (picturing the math
sign: +), you add something to any conversation or meet-
ing you are part of. That’s what being positive does, it
adds.
     When you are negative (–), you subtract something
from the conversation, the meeting, or the relationship
you are part of. If you are negative enough times, you sub-
tract so much from the relationship that there is no more
relationship left. It’s simple math. It’s the law of the uni-
verse up there on the flip chart of life: positive adds, nega-
tive subtracts.
     As in math, when you add a negative, it diminishes the
total. Add a negative person to the team, and the morale
and spirit (and, therefore, productivity and profit) of the
team is diminished.
     When you are a positive leader with positive thoughts
about the future and the people you lead, you add some-
thing to every person you talk to. You bring something of
value to every communication. Even every e-mail and
voice mail (that’s positive) adds something to the life of
the person who receives it. Because positive (+) always
adds something.
     It’s a definite plus.
     It even runs deeper than that. If you think positive
thoughts throughout the day, you are adding to your own
deep inner experience of living. You are bringing a plus to
your own spirit and energy with each positive thought.
     Your negative thoughts take away from the experience
of being alive. They rob you of your energy.
     Say this to yourself: I like this math. I like its simplic-
ity. I can now do this math throughout my day. When I
am experiencing negative thoughts about my team or my
                                       Count Yourself In / 125

to-do list, I know it’s time to take a break and regroup and
refresh. It’s time to call a time-out, close my eyes, and
relax into my purpose and my mission. It’s time to slow
down and breathe into it. I take a lot of quick breaks like
that during the day, and this practice is changing my life
for the better. It is making me stronger and more ener-
getic than ever before.
    Your own strength and energy motivates others.
    Or, as Carlos Castaneda said, We either make our-
selves miserable, or we make ourselves strong. The amount
of work is the same.


                            50. Count Yourself In
  To decide to be at the level of choice, is to take responsibility
          for your life and to be in control of your life.
                       —Arbie M. Dale, Psychologist/Author

     Leaders who take ownership motivate more effectively
than leaders who pass themselves off as victims of the cor-
porate structure or upper management.
     That’s because they have made a conscious decision
to live at the level of choice.
     Throughout their day, their people hear them talk of
buying in. They are always heard saying, Count me in.
I’m in on that.
     The reason leaders living at the level of choice say,
Count me in, is not because they’re apple-polishing,
bootlicking company people. As a matter of fact, they don’t
much care who their company is! They’re going to play full
126 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

out for the company because it makes life more interesting,
it makes work a better experience, and it’s more fun. Whether
it’s a volleyball game on a picnic or the company’s latest big
project, it is more fun to buy in and play hard.
     Let’s say the company orders everyone to break up
into experimental teams. The manager with the victim’s
mind may say, I’ll wait and see if this is a good idea. Why
are they throwing new stuff at us now? It’s not enough that
I have to work for a living; I’ve got to play all these games.
What’s this woo-woo, touchy-feely team stuff? I’m not go-
ing to buy into it yet; I’ll wait and see. I’ll give it five months.
     Meanwhile the owner-leader is saying, Hey, I’m not
going to judge this thing. That’s a waste of mental energy.
I’m buying in. Why? Because it deserves to be bought in
to? No. I don’t care if it deserves to be bought in to. I am
buying in because it gives me more energy, it makes work-
ing more fun, I deserve to be happy at work, and I know
from experience that buying into things works.
     True leadership inspires a spirit of buy-in. It’s a spirit
that has no relationship to whether the company deserves
being bought in to—no relationship at all. The source of
the buy-in is a personal commitment to have a great expe-
rience of life. That’s where it comes from. It doesn’t come
from whether the company has earned it. True leaders
don’t negatively personalize their companies. That habit
is a form of mental illness.
     You stand for mental health. And when other people
see that spirit in you, they are motivated to live by positive
example too. They can see that it works.
     In sports, it’s sometimes easier to see the value of this
spirit. It seems obviously smart for an athlete to say, I
don’t care if I’m playing for a minor league team or a major
      To Motivate Your People, First Just Relax / 127

league team, it’s in my self-interest to play full-out when I
play.
    In companies, though, that would be a rare position to
take.
    But true leaders are rare. They don’t wait for the com-
pany to catch up to their lead. They take the lead. They
don’t wait for the company to give them something good
to follow.
    No company will ever catch up with a great individual.
A great individual will always be more creative than the
company as a whole.

be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets as Michelangelo
painted or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare

             51. To Motivate Your People,
                           First Just Relax
         A frightened captain makes a frightened crew.
                  —Lister Sinclair, Playwright/Broadcaster

    The great music teacher and motivator of artists
Rodney Mercado had a simple recipe for success. He said,
There are only two principles that you need to get to play
great music or to live a great life: concentration and relax-
ation. And that’s it. That is it.
    Scott recalls this remark and what he said back to
Professor Mercado: What? That doesn’t have anything
to do with music!
128 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     It has everything to do with music.
     And the way he taught relaxation was to say, You
need to have the maximum relaxation. For instance, if you
want to play faster, Scott, you need to relax more. If you
want to play louder, you need to relax more. If you want
more sound coming out, you need to relax more.
     Up to this point in my life, it sounded like someone
saying, Well, if you want to become a cowboy, go to
Harvard. It didn’t make any sense. It seemed like a
contradiction.
     Doesn’t it sound like a contradiction? If you’re going
to be louder, stronger, and motivate people, don’t you want
to get them all hyped up and worked up? That’s what I
had always thought: light a fire! Get the lead out of your
pants!
     So up to this point in my life, if I wanted to play faster,
I would get hyped and tense up. And I would try harder.
In any aspect of my life where I was trying to get more of
something, I would become more tense from trying.
     But Mercado said, I’m going to play a passage of music
and I want you to just listen for a moment.
     I did. I don’t remember the passage played at the time,
but he almost ripped the strings off the violin. It was a
virtuoso passage, but it sounded like he was going to make
the strings just fly apart, there was so much sound and
motion being produced. And I was awed.
     Now, Scott, I want you to put your arm on top of my
forearm while I play this passage, and feel what’s going on
while I’m doing this.
     When I put my arm on top of his forearm and he played
this passage (and by the way, I’m trying to hang on for dear
life, because his arm was flying), I was stunned, because his
      To Motivate Your People, First Just Relax / 129

arm was almost totally relaxed. There was no tension in
the muscles!
     And all of a sudden, I got it.
     Getting it changed my entire concept of playing the
violin, but it also changed my concept of what I was doing
in life. I had been tensing and straining for success instead
of relaxing for it.
     The same formula works for a sprinter in track and
field. What most sprinters do when they try to run faster
is to put more effort into it. And they don’t realize it but
they tense up their muscles and their times actually drop.
Trying harder slows them down! The sprinters don’t real-
ize that they’re at their peak state of relaxation during
their fastest times.
     I saw this firsthand while on the Brigham Young Uni-
versity track team when I was in a physical education class.
I thought I was pretty tough stuff, so I raced one guy who
wasn’t on the track team. The guy barely beat me, but he
was straining and out of control, and he just stumbled over
the finish line.
     Then I met another guy who was one of the top sprint-
ers on the BYU track team, and I challenged him to a
race.
     We took off and he beat me by a wide margin. But
there he was—Mercado’s theory in motion—totally re-
laxed, totally fluid, and he just flew by me.
     So that principle is something that I have now adopted
anytime I’m doing anything. If I’m in front of a jury, or my
company, or any other group while I’m speaking, I know
that the secret is relaxation, counterintuitive as that may
seem.
130 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Because what do most people do? They get nervous,
they get tense, and their performance drops. But because
of the training Mercado gave me, anytime I feel any ten-
sion at all, I slow down and relax all the more.
     His words always come back to me: If you start shak-
ing, there’s only one way you can shake. You have to be
tense. If you relax, you cannot shake. If you start shaking,
that’s a sign that you’re not relaxing.
     Many team leaders get up in front of their teams or
their company and are so nervous about speaking that they
lose all ability to motivate anyone!
     We have attended countless conventions and retreats
where the CEO totally blows an opportunity to motivate
his people by stepping up to the podium and reading ner-
vously from a script, or making a brief and tense talk that
leaves everyone flat.
     A vice president of a large bank said to us of his CEO
after the CEO had addressed 200 senior managers at a
yearly conference:
     Did you hear him? Did you see him? I mean, we wait
all year to hear his words to us and he gives this nervous,
brief, memorized talk! Like he couldn’t be bothered to
really talk to us!
     He was obviously nervous about his talk.
     That’s my point! To him, it was something he had to
do. He obviously didn’t want to do it. So his whole focus
was on himself and what little he could get away with doing.
     What do you want? He’s not a public speaker.
     Well, if he’s going to lead a large company and ask us
to hit the goals he’s asking us to, he darn well better learn
to be a public speaker! Because it’s not about him, it’s
about us. We deserve better. We deserve someone talking
                      Don’t Throw the Quit Switch / 131

to us, and I mean really talking to us. From the heart. Loud
and strong and with passion and without a darn script!
    So, how do you really feel about his talk?
    That he came across as a pathetic little ball of ego
who doesn’t deserve to lead this company because he re-
fuses to put himself on the line. We would have been more
motivated if he had called in sick.
    If you’re in a situation where you have to give a talk to
your people and you feel tense, like it’s not coming from
the heart, practice relaxing on the spot. If your legs start
to shake, don’t worry. It’s just feedback time, and the feed-
back from your body is that you’re not relaxed. If you’re
relaxed, you cannot shake; it’s physically impossible. Once
you relax, you become a much better speaker. So don’t
just practice the talk you’re going to give. Practice relax-
ing, too.


                             52. Don’t Throw the
                                     Quit Switch
   Most people succeed because they are determined to. People
    of mediocre ability sometimes achieve outstanding success
             because they don’t know when to quit.
                            —George Allen, Football Coach

    Every Olympic athlete, every leader, and every human
being has a certain little-known brain part in common: a
Quit Switch.
    Some people, out of lifelong habit, throw the Quit
Switch at the first sign of frustration. Their workout gets
132 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

difficult, so they throw the switch and go home. Their day
of phone calls gets frustrating, so they throw the switch
and go for coffee with a coworker for two hours of sympa-
thetic negativity.
     Everyone has a Quit Switch. Not everyone knows it.
     Get to know it. Notice yourself flipping the switch.
You can’t quit and you won’t quit until you throw the switch.
A human being is built like any animal to persist until a
goal is reached. Watch children get what they want and
you’ll see the natural, built-in persistence.
     Somewhere along the way, though, we learn about this
little switch. Soon, we start flipping the switch. Some of us
begin by flipping it after a severe frustration, and then
start flipping it after medium frustrations, and until finally
it is thrown in the face of any discomfort at all. We quit.
     If you weren’t in the habit of throwing the switch too
early, you would achieve virtually any goal you ever set.
You would never give up on your team. You’d make every
month’s sales goal. You’d even lose all the weight you ever
wanted to lose. You would achieve anything you wanted
because you would not throw the switch.
     The Quit Switch is something you can focus on, learn
about, and make work for you instead of against you.
Whether you flip it early or late is only habit. The switch-
flipping habit is misinterpreted as lack of willpower, cour-
age, drive, or desire, but that’s nonsense. It’s a habit. And
like any habit, it can be replaced with another habit.
     Make it your habit not to throw the Quit Switch early
in any process. Do not quit on yourself as a leader or on
your team as producers. The less of a quitter you are, the
more of a motivator you become.
                           Lead With Enthusiasm / 133

                53. Lead With Enthusiasm
     Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
                                 —Ralph Waldo Emerson

     All the world’s a stage.
     You are a great actor on that stage.
     So, when it is your turn to appear in a scene, be enthu-
siastic! Especially if you have something about which you
need to fire up your team. If you have something to con-
vince them of, try being really enthusiastic about what you
have to say, simply as a place to come from.
     When your employee speaks in return, be enthusias-
tic. Glow. Sparkle. Radiate leadership and solutions. Pump
yourself up. Take it to an even higher level.
     When you’re ready to get the team involved, don’t fade
out—remember you are acting enthusiastic. You are an
actor, and a good one. Finish strong. Enthusiasm is conta-
gious. People love to be around it. It makes them smile
and shake their heads; it can even make them laugh with
pleasure at the dynamo that is you.
     Most managers make the mistake of not doing this.
They act reserved, cool, and professional. They don’t
act professional because they are professional; they do
it because they’re scared (about how they’re coming
across), and they think if they act cool they will be safe.
     We spoke with Jeremy about a talk we had him give to
his team.
     You seemed a little less than enthusiastic about this
new commission system, Jeremy.
134 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Really? I didn’t realize that.
    That’s the point.
    What do you mean? Jeremy asked.
    You aren’t realizing your lack of enthusiasm in front
of your team because you are choosing not to be conscious
of it.
    How is it a choice?
    You are choosing to be less than enthusiastic.
    Oh, I don’t think so. It doesn’t feel like I’m making
any kind of choice. Jeremy said.
    You speak Spanish, don’t you Jeremy?
    Yes, I do. I’m bilingual. It helps with certain customers.
    Did you realize that you gave your talk to your team
in English? Were you aware of that?
    Yes, of course.
    Did you choose that?
    Of course I chose it! The team all speaks English.
What are you driving at here? Jeremy asked.
    Your choice to speak in English was as clear and defi-
nite a choice as your choice to be unenthusiastic. You have
an equally clear choice about enthusiasm (or no enthusiasm)
as you do about choosing between English and Spanish.
We recommend you stop choosing to be unenthusiastic
with your people.
    Jeremy said nothing.
    Because being calm and professional doesn’t moti-
vate. A chilly demeanor doesn’t make much of an impres-
sion. It is immediately forgotten, along with the idea you
are promoting.
    Enthusiasm comes from the Greek words en theos,
which translate to the God within, the most spirited and
       Encourage Your People to Concentrate / 135

spiritual you. You times 10. Like the you when you were a
little kid riding your bike with no hands.
     Enthusiasm is contagious. If you are excited about your
idea, everyone else will be excited. That’s how it works.
Always remember Emerson’s observation, Nothing great
was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
     You can lead with enthusiasm, or you can lead without
enthusiasm. Those are your choices. One choice leads to a
highly motivated team; the other leads to long-term problems.
     But how can I be enthusiastic when I’m not? Jeremy
finally said.
     We have managers ask that question all the time. The
answer is easy. The way to be enthusiastic is to act enthu-
siastic. There isn’t a person in the world who can tell the
difference if you put your heart and soul into your acting.
And about a minute and a half into your acting, the funni-
est thing starts to happen: the enthusiasm becomes real.
You do feel it. And so does your team.


               54. Encourage Your People
                          to Concentrate
     The first law of success is concentration, to bend all the
      energies to one point, and to go directly to that point,
           looking neither to the right, nor to the left.
                             —William Matthews, Journalist

    The other principle that Professor Mercado believed
in was concentration, or focus. And to drive it home to his
students, he had a bizarre system.
136 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Scott recalls: Professor Mercado had us play music
recitals, as most teachers do. But at these recitals, he would
have us play our pieces twice. The first time we would play
them like at any standard recital. We would all play Mary
Had A Little Lamb on the violin and the audience would
politely clap. And then, after that performance was done
and everybody had a chance to play the traditional way,
Mercado would say, Okay, now we’re going to play it
again. Everyone’s going to have a chance to perform their
piece again.
     But this time, while the performers were performing,
Mercado would pass out slips of paper to the audience.
The slips would have instructions written on them, such
as, Go up to the performer and tickle his ear. Sing ‘Yan-
kee Doodle Dandy.’ Mercado would even say to the
performer’s accompanist, Speed up. Slow down.
Stop.
     Mercado would then physically come up to us while
we were playing and he would do things even more radical
than that! He would take our bow away. He would untune
our strings so you couldn’t get any sound out of the string.
Then, he would start tuning the instrument back up. Ba-
sically, all hell would break loose during these second
performances.
     And when it was over, he would ask each one of us,
Which performance was better? The first, normal one,
or the second one, where all hell was breaking loose?
     When I ask people nowadays what they think the an-
swer was, most people guess it was the first, normal way.
But invariably, the second performance was better. The
one in which we were most distracted! And we all admit-
ted that. And then he would ask us the question, Why?
                              Inspire Inner Stability / 137

    And the answer was pretty obvious to the musicians
who had lived through it, and that was because we were
forced to totally concentrate and focus on our music
internally. We had been compelled to exclude every other
environmental impact or influence and just wipe it out. If
we had paid any attention to what was going on around us,
we would have become hopelessly lost.
    And so by that total internal focus on what we were
attempting to produce—the music—and excluding every-
thing else, including our accompanist, we performed fan-
tastically in the face of extraordinary odds. You can’t
imagine anything that difficult.
    The lesson was huge. And I use the lesson this way:
the next time I’m upset by the chaos and problems swirl-
ing all around me, I use it to focus myself even more.
    If you want your people to be truly inspired by your
example, show them how to use distractions to focus them
even more, not less. Show them how it’s done.
    The great Igor Stravinsky once said, My freedom will
be so much the greater and more meaningful the more
narrowly I limit my field of action and the more I sur-
round myself with obstacles. Whatever diminishes con-
straint diminishes strength. The more constraints one
imposes, the more one frees one’s self of the chains that
shackle the spirit.


                   55. Inspire Inner Stability
  Becoming a leader is synonymous with becoming yourself. It is
       precisely that simple, and it is also that difficult.
                                           —Warren Bennis
138 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     People look so hard for stability. All the leaders we
coach and work with on some level or another are secretly
trying to find more stability in their work, in their careers,
and especially in their companies.
     But the key to stability is not to look outside yourself
for it. It’s useless to try to find it from your company or
from your industry. It only works to look inside. You need
to turn the mirror around so you can see yourself. You
need to find it inside your own enthusiasm for work. And
sometimes that inner enthusiasm must be built from
scratch, from improvisation.
     Psychologist Nathaniel Branden puts it this way: Chances
are, when you were young, you were told, in effect, ‘Listen,
kid, here is the news: life is not about you. Life is not about
what you want. What you want is not important. Life is
about doing what others expect of you.’ If you accepted
this idea, later on you wondered what had happened to
your fire. Where had your enthusiasm for living gone?
     Ask yourself the following questions: Do I feel good
about myself at the end of the day? Am I proud of my
leadership today? Do I feel that wonderful, little feeling
that I get when we’ve had a good day and we feel like we’ve
really nailed it? If so, that opinion is vital (and visible) to
the people I want to motivate.
     If you can consciously build that level of confidence in
yourself as a leader, then you can put stability into your
career. That’s where real stability comes from, especially
in this era of rapid-fire external changes.
     The marketplace changes, each industry changes, the
whole world changes. Every morning as we open up the news-
paper or turn on the news, something radical is different.
Something important will never be the same.
                               Give Up Being Right / 139

     This rapid change is terrifying to unstable people.
Unstable people wish things would just stay the same.
     Even if the company comes up with a new compensa-
tion plan, new pricing for customers, new ways of hiring,
or anything that might look like future stability, I still can’t
go to sleep. Change happens.
     Does anything motivate people more than to be in the
presence of a leader with inner stability and self-esteem?
     We build self-esteem in small increments just like ath-
letes build strength. They don’t do it overnight. They do it
day by day, adding a little more weight to the bar, adding a
little more distance to the run. Pretty soon, they are mag-
nificent, powerful, wonderful athletes.
     The same is true with leadership; it happens the same
way. A little bit every day—a little better at communica-
tion, a little better at delegation, a little better at servant
leadership, a little bit better at listening to people and ex-
ecuting plans. Getting 2 percent, maybe 4 percent, better.
No more than that.
     But it’s conscious and it is inspiring to be around.


                     56. Give Up Being Right
        I must follow the people. Am I not their leader?
                                       —Benjamin Disraeli

    When people are promoted to a management position,
they often feel that it’s very important that everybody sees
that they know what they’re doing.
140 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    So they twist that into a drive to be right. They think
people will only admire them if they’re right about things,
and by doing this, they make it really hard for themselves
to be human with their people. They make it hard for them-
selves to admit that they’re wrong and to say to other
people, You know what? You’re right about that.
    A really strong, motivational leader who is admired
and respected is one who does not have to be right about
anything. Ever.
    It is much more powerful to say to someone, You
know, now that I’ve listened to you, one thing I’ve real-
ized is that you are right about that. And I’m going to take
some steps to get that done. That’s a person who will
eventually motivate others.
    Because being right is never going to matter in the
long run. What’s going to matter in the long run is achiev-
ing something. I can be wrong about absolutely everything
day in, day out, and still be a wonderfully great leader.
Why? Because I brought out the best in my people. I’ve
taught them to make their own decisions. I have drawn
out their strengths, their loyalties, their high performance,
and all the numbers have tumbled in my direction.


                           57. Wake Yourself Up
 Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity.
        They seem to be more afraid of life than death.
                 —James F. Bymes, former Secretary of State

    Change will scare my people to the degree that it
scares me.
                                  Wake Yourself Up / 141

    So another way to consciously build my inner strength
as a leader is to increase my awareness of what life is like,
what the world is like, and what the business community is
like. As I become more aware of that, I become a better
leader.
    I don’t want to just put my head into the sand, and say,
But we’ve been doing it this way for 20 years.
    I don’t want to always be heard saying, I don’t want
to think about it, I don’t want to be aware that anything’s
changed. I just want everything to be like it used to be; I
want people to be the way they used to be.
    But if I don’t want to have a real understanding of
what people are like today, especially younger people, and
how they’re perceiving life, my leadership skills will de-
cline over the years, and pretty soon I’ll become almost
irrelevant.
    As Nathaniel Branden writes in Self-Esteem at Work:
      We now live in a global economy characterized
      by rapid change, accelerating scientific and tech-
      nological breakthroughs, and an unprecedented
      level of competitiveness. These developments
      create demands for higher levels of education
      and training than were required from previous
      generations. ... What is not understood is that
      these developments also create new demands on
      our psychological resources. Specifically, these
      developments ask for greater capacity for inno-
      vation, number one, self-management, number
      two, personal responsibility, number three, and
      self-direction.
   It used to be that leaders were led by other leaders,
managers were managed by other managers, and there
142 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

wasn’t that much wiggle room in between. We were told
what to do, then we told other people what to do, and it
was basically a hierarchical, military-type system. A top-
down silo.
     But now, things are so complex and ever-changing—
it’s like calling audible plays at the line of scrimmage ev-
ery single time, instead of running regular plays. That’s
what global business life is like right now. Life has changed
profoundly. And it will continue to change even faster as
time goes on. That’s good news for a leader committed to
being more and more awake to it.

    A lot of great sports players go into coaching, but it
just doesn’t quite work. Sometimes, it turns out, they’re
just not very good at it.
    And there’s a reason. It’s not mysterious. They are
simply not totally conscious of what it was that made them
great players. A lot of what they did as players was intui-
tive and subconscious. It was the feel of the thing. And so
they have a very hard time teaching it to others and com-
municating it because they didn’t even know what it was.
    The best batting coach of all time was Charlie Lau. He
taught a baseball player by the name of George Brett how
to hit. And, as you may know, George Brett was one of the
greatest hitters of all time, hitting in the high .300s all the
                                Always Show Them / 143

time. But Charlie Lau—his coach, his instructor, his
teacher—had a lifetime batting average of .255! Charlie
Lau was a mediocre hitter at best.
    But because Lau had to struggle so hard just to stay in
the majors, just to keep his job, he learned hitting inside
and out. He became extremely conscious of how it was
done. Therefore, he was great at teaching it.
    So when you figure something out, anything, that your
people are not doing up to the level that you’d like them to
be doing, show them what to do. Take the bat in your own
hands and show them how to hit.
    Christina wanted our opinion of a problem she was
having with her team.
    My people aren’t great with customers, Christina
said. I believe they leave a lot of business on the table.
    Tell us how you’d like your people to be different.
    Well, here’s what I think, said Christina. I bet if
my people talked to customers a little differently, asked
them more questions, got more interested in their lives,
that they’d find out a few other areas in which they could
help them out. They’d find out areas where we might have
a product or a service that would help the customer. In-
stead, my people just sell people things, they’re just order-
takers, and our sales aren’t as high as they could be if my
team took a greater interest in the customer.
    What have you done about that?
    First, I sent that opinion around in an e-mail, and
that didn’t go over very well, said Christina.
    Of course it wouldn’t.
    Right, she said. Then I called some of my managers
and said, ‘I want you to get your people to do more of this!’
144 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Did that go well?
    No.
    What else did you do?
    I called HR, said Christina. I told HR we really
needed training in this. Relationships. The upsell.
    How did the training go?
    Still waiting, said Christina. I’m still waiting for an
answer to my request for it.
    Christina, do this yourself! A true leader, a really
powerful leader, who’s consciously motivating others to
great performance, will show them how to do it. A true
leader will figure out what it is that she wants her people
to do and then will go in and demonstrate it.
    We watched Christina later as she talked to her team.
    Here, let me work with you today, she told them. I
want to talk to customers who come in. All I’d like you to
do is be with me and watch me do it, be there, help out,
ask questions if you can think of them. But let me do the
work.
    Christina learned to show people the way she wished
they would do it. She realized that the best way to commu-
nicate that was to do it herself. That was her new leverage
point, and by doing it that way her people got excited and
understood quickly.
    If you just tell your people, I want you to do more of
that, you’ve got to get better at that, it falls on deaf ears,
and sometimes even worse. Sometimes it causes people to
defend how they’re doing it. Or it causes people to tell
you, I don’t have time to do that.
    To really motivate, talk less and demonstrate more.
                              Focus Like a Camera / 145

                   59. Focus Like a Camera
  Most of the successful people I’ve known are the ones who do
                  more listening than talking.
                                         —Bernard Baruch

     We want to introduce a kind of leadership that we find
in only one out of every 10 leaders we work with.
     We call it focused leadership. It’s the ability on the
part of a leader to be absolutely focused. And what we
mean by focused is not hard-core, intense concentration,
as if you’re forcing something. It’s really the opposite. It’s
a much more relaxed sense of focus.
     So what we’d like you to do is picture a camera focus-
ing: you’re looking through the camera and it looks fuzzy,
and as you turn the focus dial or knob, you don’t have to
jam it or whack it or slam it. All you have to do is move it
very gently one way or the other, and, all of a sudden, the
whole picture comes into focus. That same thing can hap-
pen with your outlook as a leader.
     Someone will walk into your office and sit down. No-
tice that you are beginning to focus on him like a camera,
because there’s that internal dial in you that is very slowly
moving until the person across the way comes into a gentle,
relaxed, absolute focus.
     And now, you may breathe a sigh (go ahead), and take
a deep breath, and say, Tell me what’s on your mind.
How’re you doing? Let’s talk about this issue here.
     Your employee will pick up on this gentle, relaxed sense
of focus, and be honored by it. They will be thinking this
about you: It’s as if we’re the only two people in the world
146 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

right now. It feels like we’re on a desert island and we’ve got
all the time in the world.
     You will be thinking, And I’m listening to you, and
you and I are going to get to the bottom of this. But not in
a rushed way, and not because we have to. But because
that’s where the conversation will take us in an open way.
In a way that honors you and acknowledges you, and hears
you, and we just talk. We’re going to exchange some ideas,
I’m going to ask you some questions, and we’re going to find
out what the two of us think about this. I’m not going to tell
you what to do. And I’m not someone who’s got an agenda
that’s hidden that I’m going to reveal to you bit by bit as I
talk to you. I’m wide open. I’m like a camera.
     And you are a great leader.
     You already know the other kind of leader, the not so
great one; the leader who comes into meetings carrying
his electronic organizer, and while he’s sitting in the meet-
ing, he’ll be returning e-mails, picking up his vibrating cell
phone every two or three minutes to see who it is, and also
trying to be in the meeting.
     He’s thinking he’s multitasking, but really, he’s just
not focused. And everyone who runs into that leader feels
diminished by the exchange.
     We talked to Richie about a leader of his who behaves
that way.
     I always feel about him that he’s someone who has no
time for me, Richie said. That’s someone who’d really
rather not be talking to me right now. The minute I sit
down he rattles off a list of ideas he has. He doesn’t care
what I think.
                           Focus Like a Camera / 147

    That leader doesn’t know that of the hundred people
he communicated with that week in some form—some by
e-mail, some by PDA, some by fax, some by phone, some
in person, some in the hallway—all 100 people have been
distanced by this behavior.
    And maybe, deep down, this dysfunctional manager
senses the distancing that’s happening. And so he has an
uneasy feeling. He must fix this sense of things not going
right. But rather than slowing down, he speeds up even
more!
    Once we told a manager who behaved this way that he
ought to wear a sign around his neck.
    What do you mean a sign around my neck?
    You ought to wear a sign, like people do in treatment
centers when they’re trying to solve a personal issue, and
the sign should say, ‘I HAVE NO TIME FOR YOU.’
    He said nothing.
    You also might want to have your e-mail send an au-
tomatic reply to people saying, ‘I HAVE NO TIME FOR
YOU.’
    Why would I do that? I could never do that, he said.
    You’re doing it now. You’re sending that message
now. This way, you’d just be more up front about it.
    When we coach managers to open up and focus on
their people, like a camera, it actually saves them time in
the long run. Because it takes a lot less time to manage a
motivated, trusting team than it does to work with a de-
moralized, upset team.

                  60. Think of Management
                                   as Easy
   Always think of what you have to do as easy and it will be.
                                 —Émile Coué, Psychologist

    A thought is more than a thought, it creates your reality.
    The role of thought in managing people and results
cannot be overestimated. What you think about how hard
your work is more important than any so-called inter-
preted reality about your work.
    If you think motivating people is hard, it is hard.
There’s no difference. As Shakespeare said, There is noth-
ing bad nor good, but thinking makes it so.
    If you think it’s hard and uncomfortable to get on the
telephone, then it is. If you think you’re happy and re-
laxed picking up the phone, then you are.
    It’s important to see the power that thought has in the
world of leadership. If you’re thinking thoughts that bring
you down, you’re not going to have a very good people
day. Leadership requires high levels of humanity. To be
great leaders, we need to share our humanity and receive
our people’s humanity all day.
    You can be a leader who is successful at motivating
others. Thought is the key.
    When Napoleon Hill wrote Think and Grow Rich
(Ballantine Books, Reissue Ed., 1990) his point was that
you can think yourself into a perfect position to become
successful. Many people have followed his instructions and
done it. We can also do it. Is it easy? Actually it can be.
For as the great and celebrated psychologist Coué said,
            Cultivate the Power of Reassurance / 149

Always think of what you have to do as easy and it will be.
   One thing’s for sure: It can’t be harder than you think it is.


                   61. Cultivate the Power of
                                Reassurance
      In organizations, real power and energy is generated
       through relationships. The patterns of relationships
     and the capacities to form them are more important than
              tasks, functions, roles, and positions.
              —Margaret Wheatly, Management Consultant

    One of the most valuable additions to a person’s life
that a leader can provide is reassurance.
    You won’t hear about it in any management seminars,
and that’s a shame, because there’s nothing more motivat-
ing than a healthy dose of reassurance.
    How many leadership books focus on it? None. How
important is it as a management tool? It’s the most impor-
tant tool.
    How many times during the day do you ask yourself,
How reassuring was I in that conversation? How many
times before a conversation do you ask yourself, Now,
how can I be really reassuring to this person, so that they
leave reassured that everything’s going to be all right, and
that they’ve got the skills to do this job?
    If you integrate reassurance into your personal system
and managerial approach, things will change on your team.
The state of mind of your people will be altered for the
better.
150 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    People look to their leaders for reassurance. Period.
Truth is, they don’t get that reassurance most of the time.
They get the opposite. They get the impression that the
team is racing and behind the gun. Their manager’s de-
meanor and language cries out, We’ve got to go, go, go.
I’m late, I’m sorry I’m late for my meeting with you. I’m
on the phone and it’s rush, rush, and we’re behind the
eight ball, and it’s crazy around here.
    The problem with that message is that it’s not reassur-
ing. When you do the chaos act and convey a crisis men-
tality, it undermines productivity. The last thing you
wanted.
    The concept that counters all of that and cures it for-
ever is the concept of reassurance. Once you’got the con-
cept, make it a practice. Watch the results.


           62. Phase Out Disagreement
    The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.
                    —Linus Pauling, Nobel Prize–Scientist

    When you listen to another person during a meeting
or in a one-on-one, one of the best things you can do is to
stop disagreeing.
    In other words, listen for the value in what someone
has to say; don’t listen for whether you agree with them,
because every time you disagree with one of your employ-
ees, you throw them off balance and put them in a worse
mood than they were before.
                        Phase Out Disagreement / 151

    If I disagree with you, what will you do? You will defend
yourself. Won’t you? All humans do. And you are human. So
you go on the defensive. You don’t just say, Oh, okay,
yeah, I see your point of view. Yes sir, you’re right, and I
was wrong, and so that’s good. I’m in a better mood now.
What else do you disagree with? That won’t happen.
    If you’re going to disagree with someone, accept the
consequences.
    The main consequence: you’ve lowered that person’s
mood. And the consequence of putting someone in a low
mood? That person’s not going to do a very motivated
job. People do not do well when they’re in a low mood.
Their energy goes away.
    However, if you were to start listening for the value in
what people had to say, instead of whether you disagreed
with them, their moods would still be good as you talked.
In fact, by listening for the value in everyone in the team
meeting instead of listening for whether you agree, the mood
of the whole room will rise. You can influence an entire
team meeting by having it be your personal policy as a leader
to always listen for the value in what someone has to say.
    Most managers don’t do that. Most managers let some-
one talk, and then say, No, that’s not right. I don’t agree
with that.
    Then they wonder why their employees now feel un-
dervalued. But it was the manager’s obsession with dis-
agreement that made the employee feel undervalued.
    How does making someone feel stupid make someone
ready to be more motivated? Does anyone ever think,
Okay, you’ve made me feel stupid, I’m really ready to
work hard now. I’m feelin’ stupid, let’s go!
152 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Most managers tell us, Well, if I disagree, I disagree.
All I’m doing is disagreeing.
    Okay, but every time you disagree, you’re going to
challenge somebody and make them feel stupid, and that’s
the consequence. Sometimes you have to disagree. But
the less you do, the better the team will be for you. The
more motivated your people will be.


                             63. Keep Learning
               Leaders grow; they are not made.
                                       —Peter F. Drucker

     Stay on your learning curve. And let your people see
you learning. Don’t show them a know-it-all attitude all
the time.
     Let them know that you are a work in progress. That
will make it easier for them to approach you with good ideas.
     Most managers are so insecure in their role that they
continuously try to look like they know more than every-
one else. They never go to seminars. They scorn the latest
book on management theory. But this attitude is actually
demoralizing to their followers.
     We all can learn something new about our profession
every day. Little by little, we can add to our knowledge
base, and that increases our professional strength and ca-
pacity to help others.
                   Learn What Leadership Is Not / 153

   64. Learn What Leadership Is Not
The great leaders are like the best conductors—they reach beyond
            the notes to reach the magic in the players.
                     —Blaine Lee, Management Consultant

     Managers make a big mistake when they get bossy. It
is a sure sign of insecurity when you push the point that
you’re the boss.
     You can be decisive and courageous, and hold people
accountable without ever being pushy and bossy about it.
     Dee Hock, founder and CEO emeritus of VISA
International, put it this way: Control is not leadership;
management is not leadership; leadership is leadership is
leadership. If you seek to lead, invest at least 50 percent
of your time leading yourself—your own purpose, eth-
ics, principles, motivation, conduct. Invest at least 20
percent leading those with authority over you and 15 per-
cent leading your peers. If you don’t understand that you
work for your mislabeled ‘subordinates,’ then you know
nothing of leadership. You know only tyranny.
     Those are strong words for the bossy. But the bossy
are clueless about human nature, especially in these times.
All of our people are thinkers. They aren’t just robots.
The old style of militaristic leadership is no longer appro-
priate. It’s no longer leadership.
     Today’s leaders find the magic in their players.
154 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

                 65. Hear Your People Out
       I have more fun, and enjoy more financial success,
        when I stop trying to get what I want and start
           helping other people get what they want.
                       —Spencer Johnson, Business Author

    How would we know what kind of a leader you are?
    There is one very fast way: We would ask the people
who follow you. They know. And what they say is true.
You are who they say you are.
    So listen to them! Understand them. People are highly
motivated by listeners, listeners like you who get what
their problems are. Always be mindful.
    In the words of Thich Nhat Hanh:
      When we are mindful, we notice that another
      person suffers. If one person suffers, that per-
      son needs to talk to someone in order to get
      relief. We have to offer our presence, and we
      have to listen deeply to the other person who is
      suffering. That is the practice of love—deep lis-
      tening. But if we are full of anger, irritation, and
      prejudices, we don’t have the capacity to listen
      deeply to the people we love. If people we love
      cannot communicate with us, then they will suf-
      fer more. Learning how to listen deeply is our
      responsibility. We are motivated by the desire
      to relieve suffering. That is why we listen. We
      need to listen with all our heart, without inten-
      tion to judge, condemn, or criticize. And if we
      listen in that way for one hour, we are practicing
                                        Play It Lightly / 155

     true love. We don’t have to say anything; we
     just need to listen.
    To help your people get what they want, be mindful of
them and listen to them until you find out what they really
want. Then, make their goals fit inside the team objec-
tives. Show them the link. That’s how long-lasting motiva-
tion finally happens.


                                66. Play It Lightly
 The leadership instinct you are born with is the backbone. Then
  you develop the funny bone and the wishbone that go with it.
                    —Elaine Agather, CEO, JPMorgan Bank

    The most motivated people we work with are not tak-
ing themselves all that seriously.
    The ones who struggle the most view the company’s
next success as their own mortgage payment or what holds
their marriage together.
    The managers who are the most creative, productive,
and innovative see business as a chess game, played for
fun and challenge. They conceive of all kinds of lovely
moves and counterstrategies. And when they lose, they
just set up the pieces again even more excitedly.
    The worst failures and most miserable people at work
are the ones who take everything too seriously. They are grim,
discouraged, and bitter. They use only 10 percent of their
brains all day. Their brains, once so huge in childhood, are
now hardened and contracted into resentment and worry.
156 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Here’s what the overly serious people miss: the fun,
the creativity, the lighthearted ideas, the intuition, the good
spirits, the easy energy, and the quick laughter that brings
people close to each other. They miss that. So no wonder
they fail at what they’re doing.
    Anytime we take something that seriously, we will find
ways to subtly and subconsciously run away from it all
day. Secretly, we are like children. We resist the serious.
    America’s most respected scholar on organizational lead-
ership today is Warren Bennis. In his book On Becoming a
Leader, Revised Ed. (Perseus Publishing, 2003), he stresses
the difference between a leader and a manager: The leader
innovates; the manager administrates. The leader focuses
on people; the manager focuses on systems and structure.
The leader inspires; the manager controls. The leader is his
own person; the manager is a good soldier. The leader sees
the long-term; the manager sees the short-term.
    G.K. Chesterton once said that angels can fly only
because they take themselves lightly.
    We say the same of leaders.


                               67. Keep All Your
                               Smallest Promises
         Great things are not done by impulse, but by a
            series of small things brought together.
                                        —Vincent van Gogh

    People are motivated by people they trust.
                Keep All Your Smallest Promises / 157

    The trust of your people is not difficult to obtain. You
can win it. And because it’s so important to motivating
them, you must win it.
    So you must never ever be late to your own meetings.
Ever. Such a thing will destroy all trust you’ve built up
with seven out of 10 people, because it means to them that
you cannot be counted on to keep your word.
    We explained this to Jeff after working with his team
for a while and noticing that he was not keeping any of his
small promises.
    Hey, it’s no biggie! Jeff would say. I’m a little late,
or I forget to get somebody a parking pass, so what? I’m a
big-picture guy. I’m not all that anal.
    It’s your word, Jeff. If you can’t keep it in the small
things, no one will trust it in any of the big things.
    Well, said Jeff, what should I do? Become some-
one I’m not? Get a personality transplant? Get some good
drugs that keep me focused?
    You must do everything you say you’re going to do
for your people, when you say you’re going to do it. If
you say you’ll call tomorrow, you must. If you say you’ll
get them the documents by Friday, you must move heaven
and earth to do that. It’s everything. Trust is earned, not
just by the big things, but even more so by the little things.
Even more so.

                           68. Give Power to the
                                   Other Person
When I’m getting ready to persuade a person, I spend one-third of
 the time thinking about myself, what I’m going to say, and two-
thirds of the time thinking about him and what he is going to say.
                                         —Abraham Lincoln

    When I’m in a leadership position, there’s always a
hidden fear inside the person I’m leading and about to
talk to.
    If I don’t understand that fear, I’m going to have a
very hard time creating agreements with that person. And
long-lasting motivation is all about creating agreements.
    My goal is to get my people to agree to work with me.
I may want them to agree with me to perform at a higher
level, or to get some work done that I think needs to be
done, or to communicate with me differently, or to treat
the customer differently. In all these cases, it’s an agree-
ment that I need.
    But there’s a reason (you know what it is by now—
here’s a hint: it’s fear) why the person on the other side
will push back at me and try not to agree with me. And
once we understand that reason, we have the ability to
create agreements much faster.
    The focus of my understanding must always be: How
do I remove the fear?
    Top hypnotists will tell you that they can’t even begin
to work with a subject whom they can’t relax. When a
person is not relaxed, they are not open to suggestion,
hypnotic or otherwise.
                  Give Power to the Other Person / 159

    Most managers who try to create agreements with
other people actually cause the fear in the other person to
get worse as the conversation goes on.
    So how do you create an agreement in such a way that
the employee’s fear buttons are not being pushed, and
they’re not pushing back in self-defense?
    By asking questions. Because questions honor the
employee’s thoughts and feelings.
    When people fear losing power and balance and push
back (with objections, defensiveness, etc.), it looks like
strength! It looks like, Well, there’s a feisty person!
There’s a person who knows his own mind. There’s a per-
son who’s not going to get pushed around.
    Not true. That’s a scared person!
    People don’t want you to sell them on your idea, they
want to sell themselves. They want it to be their idea to do the
thing, not yours. That’s the secret to motivation, right there.
    Let’s say you want one of your employees to get forms
turned back to you in a more timely manner. If you talk to
that employee in an assertive way and say, You know
what, I need to talk to you. I didn’t get those forms from
you on time. You know what happens?
    Defensiveness and fear: There’s no way I could get
them back to you on time because our computer system
was down for two days. Actually, our people did pretty
well given what was going on here at this office. We did
very well, as a matter of fact, and we’re doing better than
can be expected down here.
    Your employee is defending what went on, because
your employee is afraid that he will be judged poorly, that
he might even be asked to leave the company because he
can’t get his forms in on time. And all you’ve done—the
160 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

only mistake you have made—is you’ve put something ag-
gressively out there that pushed his button, so you’ve awak-
ened the fear, and caused him to push back.
     And if you are clueless about fear and don’t know what
is going on, you are liable to push even more buttons in
response to the fear. You might say, Well you know, that
computer system was down at another division across town
and they got theirs in on time.
     And now your employee is more frightened, even more
anxious.
     Yeah, but they’ve got a bigger staff than we do. We’re
understaffed here. Always have been.
     The more you push, the more he pushes back. The more
offensive you are, the more defensive he is. And, the more
defensive he is, the less likely he is to turn those forms in on
time next week, which is all you wanted in the first place. It
was all you wanted, but it was what you yourself made unlikely.
     This very human push–push back dynamic challenges
marriages, it slows down careers, and it makes a manager’s
life miserable.
     What a manager can do is ask gentle questions and let
the people they lead think and speak and make their own
fresh commitments. That’s how motivation happens.


               69. Don’t Forget to Breathe
In war, as in peace, a man needs all the brains he can get. Nobody
   ever had too many brains. Brains come from oxygen. Oxygen
    comes from the lungs where the air goes when we breathe.
The oxygen in the air gets into the blood and travels to the brain.
            Any fool can double the size of his lungs.
                                             —George Patton
                         Don’t Forget to Breathe / 161

    Scott Richardson recalls the role breathing plays in
achieving success as a leader. Yes, breathing, as in, Don’t
forget to breathe.
    Scott recalls: My first mentor and music coach, Rodney
Mercado, never actually mentioned it. We never spoke
about it, and yet I noticed it, and I copied him and mod-
eled him.
    Because when Mercado played an instrument, he was
taking some of the most extraordinarily deep breaths that
I’d ever heard a human being take. And so even though
he never mentioned it, I figured, if it works for him, I’m
going to do the same thing. And since then, I’ve learned
how important breath is to our energy, our focus, and
our concentration.
    So, I would take a deep breath inward right before I
started to play the violin, and then I would breathe out as
I was bowing. And then as I changed the bow stroke, I
would take another breath, and so I would breathe in uni-
son with the music I was performing. I still do this to this
day.
    Putting so much energy and intensity (Mercado’s fa-
vorite word) into the performance was what produced the
result that would move people who heard it.
    As leaders, our own energy and intensity are moni-
tored by our people. They take many of their own subtle
psychological cues from how we look—our movements
and expressions (or lack of them).
    This is why we must learn to breathe deeply and lead.
To really get out there and lead with enthusiasm. To gener-
ate excitement, and then breathe again, even more deeply.
The word inspire literally means to breathe in.
162 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    We don’t want to stagnate all day breathing shallowly
behind our desk or in front of our computer. That won’t
inspire anyone.


           70. Know You’ve Got the Time
    Start by doing what’s necessary, then what’s possible, and
              suddenly you are doing the impossible.
                                                —St. Francis

    Most managers do small things all day long. They start
the day by doing all the easy things. They go through
their e-mail over and over again. They ask themselves
subconsciously: What are some little tasks that I can do
that aren’t difficult? What are things to do that will make it
look like I’m being a manager while I figure out what really
needs to be done? If anybody were watching me, would
they say I am just doing what a manager needs to do? I’m
doing what I need to do; these things need to be done sooner
or later.
    But a motivational leader has the ability and the op-
portunity to live life differently, to take the time to live by
rational choice of priority instead of feelings, to leave the
infantile behind.
    The key is taking the time.
    And what works against this is the sense that time is
getting away, there’s really not enough time in the day.
But you can learn to stay grounded in this fact: we all have
24 hours. It doesn’t matter how rich or powerful you are,
you still only have 24 hours—not a minute more.
                       Use the Power of Deadlines / 163

    The sun rises and sets for everyone the same way. And
so there’s no sense in saying, I don’t have as much time
as other people. I’d love to do that but I don’t have the
time. That’s just not true.
    Only you can slow your own sense of time down to the
speed of life by choosing what you choose to do. And once
you do, it becomes that much easier to motivate and teach
others to do the same.


        71. Use the Power of Deadlines
        The best way to predict the future is to create it.
                                          —Peter F. Drucker

    Put your requests into a time frame. If there is no real
time frame, make one up.
    If you want a report from someone, finish your re-
quest by asking, And may I have this by the end of our
business day Thursday?
    Various dictionaries describe a deadline as a time
by which something must be done; originally meaning
a line that does not move, and a line around a mili-
tary prison beyond which an escaping prisoner could be
shot.
    Literally, it is a line over which the person or project
becomes dead! Deadlines propel action. So when you want
to get people into action, give them a deadline.
    If you make a request without including a date or
time, then you don’t have anything specific that you can
check in on. You have a wished for and hoped for
164 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

action hanging out there in space with no time involved.
People are only motivated when we use both space and
time. The space-time continuum is a motivator’s best
friend.
     Once, we were leisurely writing a book when the pub-
lisher called back to impose a month-away deadline to
make the fall catalog for the big Christmas sales season.
Then, all of a sudden, we swung into gear, writing and
editing 10 hours a day, until we delivered the finished
manuscript to our publisher. It turned out to be the best-
written book we’d ever done.
     Without a deadline, there is no goal, just a nebulous
request that adds to the general confusion at work. You
will be doing a person a favor by putting your request into
a time frame. And if the time is too short, he or she can
negotiate it. Let your people participate. It isn’t a matter
of who gets to set the deadline, it’s a matter of having one.
Either way, it is settled, clear, and complete.
     Most managers don’t do this. They have hundreds of
unfulfilled requests floating around the workplace, be-
cause they aren’t prioritized. Those requests keep get-
ting put off.
     Don’t they?
     Deadlines will fix all of that.
                     Translate Worry Into Concern / 165

                              72. Translate Worry
                                     Into Concern
         Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage.
          —William Ellery Channing, Minister/Psychologist

     Leaders don’t help anyone by worrying.
     Worry is a misuse of their imagination.
     Practice upgrading your worry to concern. Then, once
you state your concern, create your action plan to address it.
     If we respond to our problems in life by worrying about
them, we will reduce our mood and energy, and lower our
self-esteem. Being a worrier is hardly a powerful self-concept.
It also is not inspiring to others when they see their leader
worrying.
     Instead of worrying, imagine some action you could
take now, something bold and beautiful inspired by the
current so-called problem. Getting into that habit raises
self-esteem and increases energy levels and concurrent love
of life.
     People are more motivated by people in love with life
than by people who worry about life.

                       73. Let Your Mind Rule
                                   Your Heart
    If you don’t think about the future, you won’t have one.
                                              —Henry Ford

     Managers who approach life as if they’re still children,
or as adults who are living out their unresolved childhood
issues, will not be able to focus on their employees, their
customers, or the hunt for great prosperity.
     Leadership requires that your logical, problem-solving
left brain be in charge of your right brain. It requires a
fierce intellect willing to hang in there against all your
people’s complaints (real and imaginary). It requires a thrill
in finding a new route to solutions.
     Leadership requires that the chess master in you be in
charge of the thinking and decision-making processes
throughout the day.
     Leadership is about making clear, smart decisions about
where and how you spend your time. Leading people is
about getting smarter with your time every day. The great
chess master Kasparov lived by his motto: Think seven
moves ahead.
     Intellectually, motivating others is about reverse engi-
neering. You decide what you want, and then you think
backwards from that. You begin at the end and engineer
backwards to this fresh moment right now. Always have
the end in mind when you approach your team or when
you make that phone call.
     Those people best at motivating others are the ones
who are the most conscious of what they’re doing. They
           Build a Culture of Acknowledgment / 167

are the continuous thinkers, and their people appreciate
them for it.
    As you drive around today, think things through. Think
about what you would appreciate most if you were a mem-
ber of your own team. Think about ways to connect and
gain trust. Think. Think about that nice extra touch, that
nice little piece of communication you want to make. Think
about the questions you want to ask.
    Think like a brilliant detective. It’s a crime that your
employee is not performing at her full potential. It’s a crime
that she is considering leaving the company.
    Solve that crime.


                         74. Build a Culture of
                             Acknowledgment
          I have always said that if I were a rich man
                I’d hire a professional praiser.
                                  —Sir Osbert Sitwell, Poet

    One way to motivate others better is to change the
question you ask yourself each day.
    Instead of, How do I get them to do less of what both-
ers me, I might want to change that to, What is the best
thing I can do to get my team to do more of what I want
them to do?
    Most managers find out what’s wrong, and then criti-
cize that. They look for the problems, and then they say,
We really can’t have this! You’ve got to fix this; this is
really not good enough.
168 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    But that approach causes resentment on the part of
the person who’s being criticized. What works better is
recognition, acknowledgment, and appreciation.
    So, when I’m driving in to work, I might tell myself:
I’m deliberately going to build a culture of acknowledg-
ment here—where people feel recognized for every little
thing they do. They will feel visible, and they will feel as if
they’re appreciated and acknowledged. I want them to
know that what they do is being seen, is being thought
about, and is being celebrated. That is the culture that I
will create to grow productivity.
    Whenever possible, recognize those people in front of
other people. And if possible, recognize them in front of
their families, somehow. You can always send an award or
a note from the company president to the person’s home.
You’ll want to let that person’s family see that he or she is
really appreciated.


                     75. Seize Responsibility
        Ninety-nine percent of failures come from people
              who have a habit of making excuses.
                               —George Washington Carver

     I sure wish people would take responsibility around
here! one of the attorneys in Scott Richardson’s law firm
said to him. It seems like the people I’m managing are
‘pass the buck’ artists.
     Well, have you talked to them about what responsi-
bility is? Scott replied.
     Not really, the attorney said.
                              Seize Responsibility / 169

    Play a little word game with me for a second. I will
say a word, and you tell me the first word that pops into
your head. Fair enough?
    Oh boy, here we go.
    No, this will be useful. I promise.
    Okay, shoot. What’s the word?
    What’s the first word that comes to mind when you
hear the word responsibility?
    Obligation, said the attorney.
    Great, said Scott. Now let’s break down the word
responsibility into its component parts. It literally is re-
sponse ability or the ability to respond. The ability to do
something! Responsible is response-able or being able to
respond. That’s all responsibility is. Nothing more and
nothing less. Responsibility doesn’t have anything to do
with obligation or the host of other negative words that
are associated with it, words that have an intimidating con-
notation, such as obligation, burden, debt, guilt, fault, and
so on. If you want your people to take responsibility, you
need to be clear yourself and with them that responsibility
doesn’t have anything to do with those other words. It is
simply the ability to respond, the ability to do something.
Just tell your people you believe in them. That you know
they have the ability to respond to this challenge, and you
support them in doing so.
    Steve Hardison is a life coach extraordinaire we’ve
worked with and written about extensively in previous
books (visit him at: www.theultimatecoach.net). One time
Hardison was invited to attend a board meeting of a com-
pany he was considering coaching. The first item on the agenda
was Whose fault is it that we have a $100,000 computer
system that is a piece of junk?
170 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    The president turned to one of the vice presidents and
said, Joe, this is all your fault!
    Joe quickly responded, No, it’s not. I didn’t draw up
the specs. John did!
    John quickly responded, Hey, wait a minute. I didn’t
choose the vendor. Rose did.
    Rose said, Hey, that wasn’t really my decision, I just
gave my recommendation to you!
    And so the people at the board meeting just kept pass-
ing the buck around and around the boardroom.
    Finally, coach Hardison motioned to the CEO and in-
terrupted the conversation.
    Can I say something? he asked the CEO.
    Sure, what?
    I am responsible for the computer system, an-
nounced Hardison.
    What? shot back the CEO. We barely even know
who you are! Why would you say anything so crazy?
    Someone needs to be responsible! said Hardison.
    Oh, yeah, replied the CEO.
    Once Hardison had taken responsibility for the com-
puter system, he was able to lead the discussion on how to
move forward and solve the problem. This is true response
ability rather than responsibility = blame. Hardison wanted
to have the ability to move the problem into a solution
mode.
    Another one of our affiliate coaches started as a sales-
person at a high-tech company. In less than two years, he
was the CEO. When he was asked how he did it, he said,
I considered it my company from day one. If I saw a
piece of paper on the floor, I either picked it up or got
                    Get Some Coaching Yourself / 171

someone to do it. If there were a division of the company
that was not working, I got involved and got it running
better, even though technically it had nothing to do with
my job. After a while, they asked me to be the CEO, but
I had already taken responsibility for the entire company
long before.
    So if you would like to be the CEO someday, start
from this moment taking 100-percent responsibility for the
entire company. Nothing will motivate your people more
than that.


      76. Get Some Coaching Yourself
                  A teacher affects eternity.
          He can never tell where his influence stops.
                     —Henry B. Adams, American Historian

    Great coaches always cite the coaches from whom they
themselves have learned.
    In today’s environment, most of today’s top busi-
ness leaders (surveys show more than 70 percent) have
coaches—personal success coaches or life coaches—who
take them to higher levels of success than they ever could
have attained on their own.
    The object of the coaching process is to allow the leader
to discover his or her hidden strengths and to bring them
to the forefront in the daily life of the business.
    Every great actor, dancer, and athlete credits most of
their career progress to a coach who gave them support and
teaching along the way. In the past, our society celebrated
172 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

the concept of coaching in sports and show business, be-
cause those were fields where excellence was always ex-
pected. On the other hand, business was just business.
    But now because of the growth of coaching, today’s
business leader has the same opportunity to explore the
upper limits of his or her excellence as does a sports star
or an actor. Coaching makes that opportunity a conscious
part of the leader’s career.
    I absolutely believe that people, unless coached, never
reach their maximum capabilities, said Bob Nardelli,
former CEO of Home Depot.
    If you’re a leader, be open to being coached. There’s
no value in going it alone just to prove you can.


               77. Make It Happen Today
     What would be the use of immortality to a person who
              cannot use well a half an hour?
                                  —Ralph Waldo Emerson

    The ability to motivate others well flows from the im-
portance that we attach to the concept of today.
    What can we do today?
    John Wooden was the most successful college basket-
ball coach of all time. His UCLA teams won 10 national
championships in a 12-year time span. Wooden created a
major portion of his coaching and living philosophy from
one thought—a single sentence passed on to him by his
father when Wooden was a little boy: Make each day your
masterpiece.
                              Learn the Inner Thing / 173

     While other coaches would try to focus their players
on important games in the future, Wooden always fo-
cused on today. His practice sessions at UCLA were ev-
ery bit as important as any championship game. In his
philosophy, there was no reason not to make today the
proudest day of your life. There was no reason not to
play as well in practice as you do in a game. He wanted
every player to go to bed each night thinking, Today, I
was at my best.
     Most of us, however, don’t want to live this way. The
future is where our happiness lies. So we project things
into the future. The past is where the problem began, so
we also spend lots of time in the past. But every good thing
that has ever happened, happened now, right now. Lead-
ership takes place now, too.
     Today is your whole life in miniature. You were born
when you woke up, and you’ll die when you go to sleep.
It was designed this way so that you could live your whole
life in a day. Do you still want to walk around telling your
team you’re having a bad day?
     When your people see you making each day your mas-
terpiece, they will pick it up as a way to live and work.


                  78. Learn the Inner Thing
    Your vision will become clear only when you can look into
      your own heart. Whoever looks outside only dreams,
               whoever looks inside also awakens.
                                                —Carl Jung
174 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Most managers and leaders in this country subcon-
sciously use a Western model of macho warfare for lead-
ership. It is an ineffective model.
     Scott studied kung fu in Taiwan, and his instructor
taught him about inner forces in every human being that
can be called on to achieve great things. As Scott rose to
prominence as an attorney and a consultant, he credited
his martial arts training for much of his insight.
     Scott recalls: I saw demonstrations when I was in
Taiwan and the United States of kung fu masters who, for
instance, set up three candles. They had a piece of clear
glass in between their face and the candles, so they couldn’t
blow on the candles. And they proceeded to, in what looked
like slow motion, move their fist toward the flame, and
from a distance of at least 12 inches, put out these flames.
One of my friends, a black belt in karate, watched the
demonstration with me. He turned to me and said, Scott,
you’ve studied kung fu, haven’t you?
     I said, A little bit.
     And he said, How do they do that? I’m a black belt in
karate and one of our tests is we have to be able to put out
a candle flame with our strongest kick. We can come as
close to the candle flame as we can, and I had to train
hours and hours to do that. It’s physically impossible to
do it from 12 inches away with the strongest kick I have. I
could never do it with a slow-motion punch. How do those
guys do it?
     I replied, Well, actually it’s based on something called
‘ki.’
     In this conversation, in this moment, now that I think
about it, I can now extend ki, and change my body posture
                             Learn the Inner Thing / 175

slightly and be practicing the advanced martial art of aikido,
which I’m just doing as I became aware of it.
     So with any activity involving a physical body, you can
be practicing a version of this martial art aikido. The basic
principles of extending ki include focusing on your one
point and thinking about that. In aikido, they teach you
that if you focus your attention on your one point, which
is a point 2 inches below your navel, you automatically are
centered.
     That’s all you have to do. You can do it in a team
meeting. You can do it during a one-on-one performance
review. There’s no great mystery about it.
     The aikido instructor does a demonstration where he
says, Okay, focus on your one point, and while you’re
focused on your ki point below the navel, he presses on
your chest but you don’t fall over. You’re very centered
and strong. Then if he lightly slaps you on the top of your
head with one hand (to change your focus) then pushes on
your chest with the other, you do immediately fall over
backwards.
     And he says, What just happened? You had your
awareness on your one point and, when you did, I couldn’t
push you over. And then as soon as I slapped you on the
top of your head, what happened? Your awareness went
up there to your head and I pushed you over without even
trying.
     I did this simple demonstration to my father, the
doctor—the world’s biggest skeptic—and he said, There
must be a physical explanation for it. But there was not. He
hadn’t moved a muscle in his body! Nothing physical. Just
his focus. And that was the difference between his being
grounded and centered and strong, and then losing focus.
176 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Most people in the workplace are not centered. They
live off the top of their heads where, basically, anything
that comes up in life is going to tip them over. Tip them
off center.
    As their leader, you can model being centered. You
can radiate the immovable life force, the ki inside you. In
your next managerial challenge, try relaxing and allowing a
force greater than yourself to flow through you and then
out into the situation. And it won’t be long before you, too,
are a legend in your organization, for simply being centered.


                    79. Forget About Failure
     A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable
       but more useful than a life spent in doing nothing.
                                    —George Bernard Shaw

     Managers, especially at the beginning of their careers,
often obsess about failure. They take a bad conversation
with a problem employee very personally. They get hurt.
They get depressed. They get angry and start hating their
profession.
     But soon they see that failure is just an outcome. It is
not bad or good, just neutral. It can be turned into some-
thing good if it’s studied for the wisdom to be gained from
it. And it can be turned into something bad if it is made
into something personal.
     The great professor of linguistics S.I. Hayakawa used
to say that there were basically two kinds of people: the
kind of person who fails at something and says, I failed at
                   Follow Consulting With Action / 177

that and the person who fails at something and says, I’m
a failure.
     The first person is in touch with the truth, and the
second person is not.
     I’m a failure!
     That claim doesn’t always appear to the outsider to be
a lie. It can look like a sad form of self-acceptance. In
fact, we can even associate such exaggerating with truth-
ful confession: Why not admit it? I’m a failure.
     But in psychological terms, what we’re hearing is the
voice of fear. It’s the opposite of a voice of purpose; it is a
voice of surrender, of internal defeat, of quitting before I
begin. (Defeat and failure on the external can actually be
refreshing and rejuvenating. The great football coach Woody
Hayes used to say after his team lost a game, Nothing
cleanses the soul like getting the hell kicked out of you.)
     As you lead people today, always keep in mind this
one true fact: there is nothing wrong with them. They have
it inside themselves to prosper and excel as professionals.
Get connected to that truth and show your people how to
leave all their I’m a failure thoughts in the trash where
they belong.


    80. Follow Consulting With Action
                      Action is eloquence.
                                             —Shakespeare

   Scott has been practicing law for more than 20 years,
had his own law firm for 17 years, and even owned another
178 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

law firm, which he sold during that time. Right now, he
has 15 employees and he coaches other lawyers as well.
    He states: There’s no question in my mind that it is
one thing to be a coach, another thing to be in the role of
the CEO. I think the perspective of being the one in the
hot seat, so to speak, is extremely valuable. Having been
both roles, I have coached and been coached, I know a coach
can be absolutely invaluable to the person in the hot seat.
    But you can bring in the world’s greatest coach, and if
the person in the hot seat still chooses, for whatever rea-
son, not to take the coaching, then the effort is lost.
    That’s the reason leaders are the most important people
in the organization, because they can choose not to make
things happen as well as to make things happen.
    A coach is not going to wave a magic wand and cause
things to change regardless of that decision. It can’t work
that way. In the end, a coach can only shine a light and
assist. It’s always the willingness of the leader to generate
the action that makes a true difference. So if you are get-
ting coaching, follow it up with action. Massive action. To
do so will be eloquent.


                               81. Create a Vision
The reason most major goals are not achieved is that we spend our
                 time doing second things first.
               —Robert J. McKain, Management Consultant

    Without creating a vision for my team, my team will
live according to its problems.
               Stop Looking Over Your Shoulder / 179

     Without goals (the subsets of vision), my team will
just fight fires, work through emotional upsets, and worry
about the dysfunctional behavior of other people. I, my-
self, as their leader, will have attracted a problem-based
existence. Soon, I will only end up doing what I feel like
doing, which will sell me short and draw on the smallest of
my own brain’s resources.
     But when we humans begin to create, we use more of
the brain. We rise up to our highest functioning as hu-
mans. So it’s my primary job as a motivator to create a
vision of who we want to be, and then live in that picture
as if it were already happening in this very moment.
     And it has to be a vision I can talk about every day. It
can’t be a framed statement on the wall that no one can
relate to after some company retreat is over. It is not sur-
prising that one of the biggest complaints about leaders
that show up on employee surveys is, He had no idea
where we were headed. He had no vision of our future
that he could tell us about.
     Create a vision. Live the vision.


                        82. Stop Looking Over
                                Your Shoulder
 Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that
           something else is more important than fear.
                 —Ambrose Redmoon, American Philosopher

    There’s no one less motivational to be around than some-
one who is always trying to anticipate other people’s criticisms.
180 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    The worst trap for you as a leader is to begin antici-
pating what your own leaders think of you from moment
to moment, to do superficial things to impress them, rather
than doing real things to encourage your own people.
    Great leadership by example (such a great motivator
of others) comes from getting independently better at what
you do, and not living in anticipation of other people’s
opinion of you.
    It allows you to increase your leadership strength ev-
ery day, and to build your self-esteem.
    Paradoxically, the more you focus on doing your own
best work and staying in action to fulfill your personal and
professional goals, the more help you are to others.


                            83. Lead by Selling
              Everyone lives by selling something.
                                  —Robert Louis Stevenson

    Dan Kennedy is a local marketing expert who has done
a lot of direct sales in his lifetime. He has made the obser-
vation that the most successful doctors, lawyers, teachers,
and businesspeople that he works with invariably have some
sales experience in their background.
    Scott recalls: I was wondering, before, why I’ve never
had a problem enrolling people in projects. It’s just been
very easy for me, always. And then I heard Dan Kennedy’s
observation: You know, he’s right! Before I had had some
direct sales experience, I was very poor at enrolling people
in projects and ideas. Afterward, I was great. So let me tell
you how I experienced that transformation in my life.
                                   Lead by Selling / 181

     Before I went to college, I decided to spend a summer
selling books door-to-door in Pennsylvania. I attended a
week-long sales training school put on by a company called
Southwestern, the largest door-to-door book sales com-
pany in the United States. (They primarily use college stu-
dents to work during the summer.)
     During this week, we learned our basics. It was the
old-style selling: You learned your sales pitch and memo-
rized it. Then you learned about door approaches, how to
inspire confidences and get in and make your presenta-
tion, and how to close (gracefully asking for the order).
Just classic selling.
     The very first house I called on, I actually sold some-
thing. And I thought, Man, this stuff really works. This is a
piece of cake.
     And that was the last sale I had for two weeks. And so
my sales manager decided to start working with me to see
what wasn’t working. He gave me a diagnosis, Scott, you’re
not closing. You’re not even asking for the sale.
     What do you mean I’m not closing? Of course I’m
closing.
     No, you’re not. You didn’t close once.
     I didn’t?
     No. Look, I know we taught you to close at least three
times, but for you there’s no limit. Just start off showing
them a little bit about the books, then you close. And if
they say, ‘No, I’m not interested,’ you say, ‘I know just
what you mean,’ and you show them a little bit more, and
you close again.
     So I said, That’s crazy. They’re going to throw me
out on my butt!
182 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Just try it.
     Well, I figured the other way wasn’t working, so what
the heck?
     So the next house we called on, I presented the books
a little bit and asked the lady for the order. She said, Well,
I’m really not interested.
     That’s fine, I know exactly what you mean, I said.
     Then I showed her a little bit more and asked her again.
And she said, Well, I don’t know, I don’t have the money.
     I know exactly what you mean, I said.
     And I showed her a little bit more and closed her again.
I closed her at least five times and I thought, Man, how
long is this going to take? I guess she hasn’t kicked me out,
so I’ll keep going.
     And finally, I think on the sixth close, she said, Okay!
     I was shocked.
     Later on, something very surprising happened.
     It turned out that this nice lady worked in a bank right
there in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. One day, when I went
to the bank to bring all my checks from my sales to de-
posit, I saw her there. She was working as a teller. I put
my checks in to deposit, and she seemed very embarrassed
to see me. So I thought, Oh my gosh, maybe I just
ramrodded her into buying and now she feels bad. But oh
well, we always tell them they can cancel the order.
     So I shoved my checks toward her and said, I want to
deposit these checks.
     And she said, You know, Scott, I hope you didn’t
mind that I took so long to decide, but I just wanted to
make sure that I really wanted those books. Now I’m so
glad I bought them.
                               Hold On to Principle / 183

     What a lesson. So from then on, I’ve never been afraid
to ask. And then ask again! In terms of leadership, this
simply means asking for what you want, being very direct
with your requests, and having your communication cen-
tered on requests and promises.
     You can go up the ladder to the people who lead you
and make bold requests on behalf of you and your team.
You can do the same with major customers. Also, with
your own direct reports, figure out what you want your
people to buy in to, and then sell them on the idea. But
don’t forget to close them. Don’t forget to make a strong,
specific request (the close), and then receive a strong, spe-
cific promise in return.


                    84. Hold On to Principle
          In matters of style, swim with the current;
           in matters of principle, stand like a rock.
                                        —Thomas Jefferson

    Discipline yourself, and others won’t need to, Coach
John Wooden would tell his players. Never lie. Never
cheat. Never steal, and Earn the right to be proud and
confident.
    We’re starting to learn why John Wooden was the most
successful college basketball coach of all time. No one has
ever even come close. No one has ever motivated his ath-
letes so superbly as Wooden.
    Rick Reilly, the talented sportswriter, recalls (A Para-
digm Rising above the Madness, Sports Illustrated, March
20, 2000): If you played for him, you played by his rules:
184 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

Never score without acknowledging a teammate. One word
of profanity, and you’re done for the day. Treat your op-
ponent with respect. Coach Wooden believed in hopelessly
out-of-date stuff that never did anything but win champi-
onships. Reilly writes that Coach Wooden’s rule that his
players could not have long hair or facial hair particularly
drove them crazy. When Bill Walton, an All-American
center, showed up with a full beard, he said, It’s my right.
Reilly goes on: Coach Wooden asked if he believed that
strongly. Walton said he did. ‘That’s good, Bill,’ Coach
said. ‘I admire people who have strong beliefs and stick by
them, I really do. We’re going to miss you.’ Walton shaved
it right then and there. Now Walton calls once a week to
tell Coach he loves him.
     You have two ways to go as a motivator of others. You
can seek to be liked or you can, like John Wooden, earn
their respect. Respect is stronger. And, when their respect
runs deep enough, you may end up being loved.


                                         85. Create Your
                                          Relationships
A life of reaction is a life of slavery, intellectually and spiritually.
          One must fight for a life of action, not reaction.
                           —Rita Mae Brown, Mystery Author

     When we are coaching leaders who are having a tough
time motivating others, it always becomes apparent that
their basic problem is that they’re reacting to their people
all day long.
                         Create Your Relationships / 185

     They’re wallowing in their own negative emotional re-
action to people. After a while, in listening to these types
of managers, we get a funny impression that we’re listen-
ing to the words of country music. You know those coun-
try songs we’re talking about. The themes are: I’ve been
hurt so many times, I’m never going to reach out again,
or I don’t trust women, or You can’t trust men. Ac-
tual songs have titles such as Is It Cold in Here or Is It
You? and My Wife Ran Away With My Best Friend and
I Miss Him.
     Country music in and of itself is great, and the really sad
songs—the ones that express the poetry of victimization—
are beautiful in their own way, but their basic philosophy
is not an effective way to create the motivated team we
want.
     Managers who go through their days reacting emotion-
ally to the behavior of their people truly are miserable.
     What those managers need is a gentle shift. Not a huge
change, but a shift, just like the gentle shift of gears in a finely
tuned car. They need to shift from reacting to creating.
     All of this reacting they do has become a habit, and
because it’s only a habit, it’s completely open to a shift.
     Business coach Dan Sullivan nails it when he says, The
difficulty in changing habits lies in the fact that we are
changing something that feels completely natural to us.
Good habits feel natural; bad habits feel natural. That is
the nature of a habit. When you change a bad habit that
feels natural to a good habit that feels natural, you feel
exactly the same. It is just that you get completely differ-
ent results.
     One of the first steps on the path out of the habit of
reacting to the people we manage is to ask ourselves a
186 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

simple question. It’s a question first asked by Ralph Waldo
Emerson many years ago: Why should my happiness de-
pend on the thoughts going on in someone else’s head?
    This question, no matter how we answer it in any given
moment, gives us the mental perspective we need to start
seeing the possibilities for creatively relating to others in-
stead of just reacting to them.


                         86. Don’t Be Afraid to
                               Make Requests
           As you enter positions of trust and power,
                dream a little before you think.
                                   —Toni Morrison, Author

    Don’t you wish you could just ask your superiors to
help your team do certain things? It would make leader-
ship much simpler if it could become a matter of requests
and promises and follow-through action. It can.
    It will help you to know, before you ask, that everyone
(your superiors, your customers, your employees) really
wants to say yes.
    We once took a seminar on communication, and one
of the exercises they gave us was designed to dramatize
the fact that most people really want to say yes.
    So they gave us an assignment over a long dinner break
to go out and make three unreasonable requests to see if
we could get people to say no. That was the assignment:
you had to get three no responses before you came back.
             Don’t Be Afraid to Make Requests / 187

    And we thought it would be simple. After Scott fin-
ished dinner, he went over to a lady at the next table and
said, You know, ma’am, I’m completely out of money,
would you mind paying for my meal?
    He figured that was a pretty unreasonable request and
he was sure she’d say, Get lost.
    And he was stunned when she didn’t say that.
    Well, I’m not sure I have enough money to cover
that right now, she said, so Scott began coaching her to
say no.
    Oh that’s okay, just asking. You can say no.
    And she wouldn’t say no! She said, Well, I’m not
sure....
    In other words, ‘no’?
    Well, I guess not. No.
    Thanks!
    Scott had to work very hard just to get her to say no.
Then when Scott walked over to the cashier to pay for the
meal, there was a man who was waiting there and Scott
thought, No problem. I’ll get a quick No from him.
    You know, I’m a little short on cash, Scott said.
Would you just have the restaurant cover my bill?
    Well, I’m not sure. What’s this about?
    Well, you can say no.
    It took him quite awhile (soon Scott was begging him
for a no), but he finally got him to say no.
    Two down, one to go. So Scott turned to the lady right
next to him and said, How about you? Would you pick
up my bill?
    She had just heard what went on, so it didn’t look like
it would be too hard! But it was. And after a very long
188 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

negotiation, after she was quite willing to pay for his meal,
she said no.
     That one exercise taught us a lot. People all want to
say yes.
     So now, whenever we have a project that we want to
create, we feel free inside to go out there and start asking
people for a yes. We don’t have any fear or hesitancy in
making what most people would call unreasonable re-
quests. Because we know from experience (after having
it verified many times over) that people’s natural tendency
is to want to say yes.
     So ask for what you want, both up and down the peck-
ing order. If your team needs something from the higher-
ups, go ask for it. When you get their yes answers, bring in
good news for your team about what the top people are
agreeing to do to move things forward. You’ll be teaching
them the power of requests.


                 87. Don’t Change Yourself
It takes a tremendous act of courage to admit to yourself that you
             are not defective in any way whatsoever.
                    —Cheri Huber, Author/Zen Philosopher

    You don’t need to change!
    A lot of people who hear our talks or read our books
contact us for coaching, saying, I really need to make a
change. I need to totally change my life. I have been an
unconscious, bossy, paranoid manager and I’m ready to
learn to be a leader.
                            Don’t Change Yourself / 189

    We tell them what we tell everyone: You don’t need to
totally change.
    All you need is a gentle shift.
    To get your sports car to send itself into a smoother,
faster gear, do you need to take out the gearbox and put in
a new one? Or do you simply need to shift gears? When
you do shift gears, is it hard to do? Hard, like changing a
tire? Or do you just slide into it?
    For your mind to take you to the next level of leader-
ship performance, all you need to do is shift gears. You
don’t need to replace your gearbox.
    Just shift. And then zoom. Zoom. Just like that.
    Do you need to change your attitude? How? Why?
What is an attitude anyway? How do you change it?
    Attitude is a word that old people use to intimidate
young people. It’s the ultimate shaming device: You bet-
ter change your attitude, Son!
    How, Dad?
    Don’t mess with me, Son.
    What is attitude, Dad? How do I access it? How do I
even identify it, much less change it?
    It’s poor, I can tell you that.
    If you were ever part of such a conversation, you got
off on the wrong track in this whole concept of change.
Reinventing yourself happens. But it happens as a result
of a series of gentle shifts. It’s a path, not a revolution. It
becomes a way of life.
    Just begin.
190 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

                   88. Pump Up Your E-mails
 No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to
 an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the human spirit.
                                                —Helen Keller

     Every e-mail communication you send to your team is
an opportunity. It’s a fresh chance to energize that team
and spread the optimism you want to fuel the contagious
enthusiasm your next project needs.
     But nine managers out of 10 ignore this opportunity.
Instead, they often send neutral e-mails; short, terse e-mails;
or sometimes even angry e-mails.
     Those are all mistakes. Because your first job, even
before your job of informing others, is to motivate others.
     So let’s begin here: realize that e-mail is a cold me-
dium anyway. There is no voice tone in it. There is no
twinkle in the eye, or warmth of expression. It’s just cold
electronic type.
     Therefore, even a neutral e-mail feels chilly to the re-
cipient. Even a simple transfer of information feels icy
and negative, unless you seize the opportunity to pump it
up. Always pump it up.
     Every communication from a manager to an employee
is an opportunity to instill optimism. Don’t waste that op-
portunity. A true leader never does.
     Look at your e-mail before you send it. Is it uplifting?
Does it contain an acknowledgment or an appreciation of
the recipient? Does it praise the recipient? Does it inspire?
Is it going to make someone happy?
                                          Stop Pushing / 191

    If not, take the extra minute to go back over it. Change
the negative tone to a positive one. Brighten it up. Ask
yourself: Would you be happy to get this e-mail? Would
you feel honored and appreciated if you received it?
    Behavioral studies continue to show that positive
reinforcement works more than seven times better than
negative criticism to change behavior.
    Negative criticism causes resentment, depression, an-
ger, and sabotage. People will sabotage your leadership if
they feel alienated and underappreciated.
    Pump things up and watch what happens. Don’t take
this on faith; use trial and error. Send half of your people
a neutral e-mail and half a positive one, and see which gets
the best results.
    You will be able to test this concept by doing it. You
will be delighted with the results you get.


                                   89. Stop Pushing
Pull the string, and it will follow wherever you wish. Push it, and
                      it will go nowhere at all.
                                   —Dwight D. Eisenhower

    Thomas Crum gives seminars on how to use aikido
philosophy in daily business life. He calls what he teaches
The magic of conflict.
    Scott remembers being there during one of Crum’s
demonstrations. Crum had someone come to the front of
the room and stand up in front of him.
192 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Put out your hand like this, said Crum as he put his
hand up as if taking an oath, touching the student’s up-
raised hand. Crum pushed on the student’s upraised hand,
and the student just naturally, automatically reacted by
pushing back.
    Crum said, That’s the natural way of human beings. I
push, you give me resistance. You push back.
    Then, he asked the student to extend his hand in the
form of a fist. He did, and then Crum put his hand in a
closed fist in front of him and they both pushed against
each other. Each fist pushing the other.
    This is the way we experience life a lot, said Crum.
Just like this. A stalemate or struggle, where I’m trying to
win or you’re trying to win. In aikido, we don’t ever resist.
    Right at that moment Crum dropped his fist down,
and instantly the volunteer pushed right by him (and, in
aikido, you turn in the direction of the person going by
you). Crum turned with the volunteer and guided him
quickly and gently to the floor.
    Crum said, Now, this is aikido. I no longer resist, so
we’re no longer fighting. And guess what? We’re in per-
fect alignment so it’s very easy for me to direct this person
wherever I choose him to go. And that’s how aikido works.
    In fact, the characters ai, ki, and do mean blending
our inner forces, not force against force. And every move
in aikido comes to that point, where both the aggressor’s
ki and your own ki are blended. Right at that point, when
the two are in alignment, I have control over the other
person and what happens to him and his body. Totally. It
takes no effort. Because we’re in complete alignment.
    The application to motivating others is profound, be-
cause I don’t really want to resist what my people are doing

or saying. I want to guide their natural inner energy to-
ward a mutual goal, theirs and mine. I want to receive and
guide my people’s natural energy. I don’t want to oppose
it or make it wrong.


                        90. Become Conscious
   A boss creates fear, a leader, confidence. A boss fixes blame, a
leader corrects mistakes. A boss knows all, a leader asks questions.
    A boss makes work drudgery, a leader makes it interesting.
                                  —Russell H. Ewing, Author

    If I’m an unconscious manager, can I be taught to be a
true leader?
    Of course I can. If you are going to turn me into a true
leader, you begin by making what is unconscious (my com-
mitments and operating principles as a leader) become
conscious and clear. That’s step one. That process is as
simple as teaching me how to use a computer program.
    Perhaps you hold a leadership meeting and state very
clearly why and how you intend to lead. You make every-
thing clear. If there are other leaders in the room, even
leaders whom you lead, you invite them to do the same.
The more open we all are about how we intend to lead, the
more motivated our people will be.
    One of the exercises we like to do in our leadership
seminars is to ask people to write down the name of some-
one in their lives whom they admired and respected as a
leader. It may be their grandmother, an old platoon leader,
or a former teacher or manager. Some people write down
194 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

a leader in history who had an influence on them, such as
John F. Kennedy or Winston Churchill.
     You might want to do this exercise right now. Think
of someone in your own life you respected as a leader. Jot
the name down. Now, write three qualities about that per-
son that you admired the most. Don’t read on until you do.
     Okay, now look at those three qualities. They may be
anything—honesty, openness, a total belief in you, creativ-
ity, nonjudgmental teaching style—whatever the three quali-
ties are, look at them. More than likely, and more than nine
times out of 10, these qualities are now in you as a leader.
And these are the three things your people would say about
you! Look at them. Is it not true? Are they not who you are?
     This is a powerful exercise because it shows you how
you have already internalized and modeled yourself after
the leaders you admired. But until now, it has been sub-
conscious. The trick is to make it conscious, and be very
awake to it every day.
     There is nothing so disheartening as a leader having a
perceived hidden agenda, which comes from overly un-
conscious values at play. It discourages your people when
they have to guess where you’re coming from every day.
     Far better to have both you and your people fully con-
scious of what you stand for.


                   91. Come From the Future
  The very essence of leadership is that you have to have vision.
              You can’t blow an uncertain trumpet.
   —Theodore M. Hesburgh, Former President, Notre Dame
                            Come From the Future / 195

    Managers often, quite unconsciously, allow team meet-
ings and one-on-one conferences to focus excessively on
the past. But the constant refrain of how things used to be
and why things were better back then demoralizes the
team. The team also sits through unnecessarily long peri-
ods of time spent hashing out, venting, and reviewing break-
downs and mistakes.
    This is done at the expense of the future. It is also
done at the expense of optimism, morale, and a sense of
good, orderly direction.
    A good motivator will not make the mistake of obses-
sive focus on the past. A good motivator will use the past
as a springboard that immediately leads to a discussion of
the future: What can we learn from that mistake that will
serve us in the future? And if this happens again, how might
we handle it better?
    To a good motivator, the past really has only one pur-
pose: to provide building material for creating the future.
The past is not used as something to get hung up on, or an
excuse for regret, placing blame, nostalgia, personal at-
tacks, and having a defeated attitude. A leader knows that
leadership means leading people into the future. Just as a
scout leader leads scouts into the woods, a true leader
leads team members into the future.
    Your shift to better leadership might include learning
to make an ever-increasing percentage of your communi-
cation focus on the future: discussing your next week, plan-
ning your next month, designing your goals for next year,
and looking at the opportunities that will be there two years
from now. Be thorough and well-prepared when it comes
to discussing the future. If the details are not always known,
the commitments, vision, and strategies are.
196 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

    Unmotivational managers will unconsciously disown
and spread fear about the future. They will say how un-
predictable and dangerous the future is. They will exag-
gerate potential problems and stress the unpredictability
of everything. They will attempt to come across as realists
when, in fact, it’s much more truthful to say that they sim-
ply haven’t done their homework.
    You’ll be motivating others to the degree that you are
a constant source of information and interesting commu-
nication about the future of the team.


                   92. Teach Them to Teach
                                Themselves
If you want a man to be for you, never let him feel he is dependent
   on you. Make him feel you are in some way dependent on him.
                               —General George C. Marshall

    Scott remembers a story that Mr. Mercado told him
about the musical virtuoso Jascha Heifetz and the always
unplayable Tchaikovsky violin concerto.
    Heifetz’s teacher was the great German violinist
Leopold Auer. Mercado said, Auer himself could not play
the Tchaikovsky violin concerto up to speed. It’d never
been performed up to speed before Heifetz.
    Heifetz was the first one to perform this piece up to
speed! And if Auer, his teacher, could not perform it up
to speed, and he was teaching Heifetz, how then was
Heifetz able to do it?
    Some people might say, Well, he was just a talent.
                    Stop Apologizing for Change / 197

     But that wasn’t the explanation according to Mr. Mercado.
He said, Scott, if Auer was only teaching Heifetz how to
play like Auer, then Heifetz would have never performed
that Tchaikovsky violin concerto up to speed. But that
isn’t what Auer was doing. He was teaching him how to
teach himself how to play the instrument. And that’s how
he learned to become better than his teacher.
     This is a very powerful distinction. And that really is
why Auer was such an extraordinary teacher.
     Your goal is to teach like Leopold Auer taught, abso-
lutely unafraid of the people you lead being better than
you are. Because that’s what a great coach and leader does.
They don’t teach us how to have a great career. They teach
us how to teach ourselves how to have a great career.


                           93. Stop Apologizing
                                    for Change
     If the rate of change on the outside exceeds the rate of
              change on the inside, the end is near.
                                               —Jack Welch

    Managers who apologize for any and all changes the
team must accommodate are sowing the seeds of low mo-
rale and discouragement.
    Every time they introduce a new policy, product, sys-
tem, rule, or project, they apologize for it. They imply
that change is harmful to the well-being of the team and
that change is something we would hope someday to not
have to suffer so much of. This is done with the unconscious
198 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

motive of seeming compassionate, and being liked, but it
results in creating a team of victims, and it dramatically
lengthens the time it takes for the team to assimilate and
become comfortable with a change.
     A true leader does not apologize for change. A true
leader does not feed into the fear that so easily accompa-
nies change. Instead, the leader is an advocate for the
change. A leader continuously communicates the benefits
of having an ever-changing organization. A leader endorses
an organization that is continuously reinventing itself to
higher and higher levels of productivity and innovation.
     Every change is made for a reason. Every change was
decided upon because the positives of the change outweigh
the negatives. So, if you wish to be a highly motivational
leader, you simply learn the positives, through and through.
You find out everything there is to know about the upside
of the change, because that’s what leadership is. Leader-
ship is communication of the upside.
     Unconscious managers are often as uncomfortable with
changes as their own people are, so they constantly apolo-
gize for them, which furthers the impression that this little
team is not in alignment with the mission of the company.
     But not you. You are a leader, and so you will always
reconnect the team to the mission of the company.
Change will not be apologized for. Why apologize for
something that will improve the strength of the orga-
nization? Every change is made (every last one of them)
for the sole purpose of strengthening the ultimate viabil-
ity of the organization.
     That’s why you advocate the change. That’s how you
sell it to your team.
                                  Let People Find It / 199

                         94. Let People Find It
     People ask the difference between a leader and a boss.
      The leader works in the open, and the boss in covert.
              The leader leads and the boss drives.
                                      —Theodore Roosevelt

     Scott again recalls coach and teacher Rodney Mercado
and his master key to getting remarkable performances
out of the people he taught and motivated:
     If you heard any two students of Mercado play side by
side, you would absolutely swear that they did not have
the same teacher. You would say it was physically impos-
sible because their playing styles were so radically differ-
ent. Most people who take music lessons are aware that
listeners can identify who a student’s teacher is by how
the student plays.
     But with Mercado, not only could you not do that, you
would absolutely swear that they couldn’t have the same
teacher, that it just couldn’t be possible.
     So how did he accomplish that? For one thing, he never
told us don’t, he never said no, and he never told us how
to play the instrument.
     A typical example, a very fundamental thing, was how
to hold the bow. He would say, Okay, Scott, what I’d like
you to do is to try holding your hand this way, and he’d
have me adopt an extreme position, like holding my hand
as far to the right as I possibly could while still being able
to use my bow. He’d have me play some music that way,
and then say, Okay, fine. Now I’d like you to do the op-
posite, and he’d have me put my hand all the way to the
200 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

left, as far as I could possibly put it—a very uncomfort-
able position—and then he’d say, Play this passage.
     He would then ask, Now, if you had to choose one of
those two extremes, which one would you choose?
     Well, all the way to the right, because it’s a little less
cumbersome than all the way to the left.
     So what that’s telling you, Scott, is that you probably
want to hold your hand position somewhere between all
the way to the right and all the way to the left, and it’s
probably going to be more to the right than to the left. So
find the way that works the best for you.
     And if I said, Well, what about if other people say
you have to hold your hand a certain way?
     Mercado would then reel off a number of examples of
professional violinists who did it differently. He’d ask me
to reason it out.
     So what is that telling you, Scott?
     Well, that there isn’t one right way to do it.
     Right, so find what works for you.
     And that was his teaching method.
     So, I learned from that, and in motivating people I
adapted it to mean that there is never one right way to do
something. Rather than showing my people the right way
to make a phone call, or gather information from a client,
I will let them develop their own ways. The lesson learned
for me way back in music class was that people will moti-
vate themselves in their own way if you gently guide them
toward the outcome you want.
                           Be a Ruthless Optimist / 201

                95. Be a Ruthless Optimist
                 A leader is a dealer in hope.
                                    —Napoleon Bonaparte

     Pessimism is the most fundamental of all the mistakes
we managers can make. It is a position, a pose, taken by
the manager of not being optimistic about the future of
the organization and, therefore, the future of the team.
     It is a refusal to prepare for team meetings by learning
the rationale behind the latest company decisions. It is a
refusal to take a stand for the success of the enterprise. It
is a refusal to be an advocate for the organization’s ongo-
ing strategy.
     It is also an exaggerated tendency to acknowledge and
agree with every issue’s downside without standing up for
the upside. Sometimes optimism is a lonely and coura-
geous position to take, which is why most managers don’t
do it. The sad thing is, it is what the team wants and needs
the most from its leader.
     While the unconscious manager doesn’t realize what
he or she is doing by being so pessimistic all the time, a
true leader knows exactly what optimism is and what it is
for: Optimism is the practice of focusing on opportunities
and possibilities rather than complaints and fears.
     A true optimist is not a brainless Pollyanna, wearing
rose-colored glasses. A true optimist is more realistic than
that. A true optimist is unafraid of confronting and under-
standing the problems in the organization. But once a prob-
lem is fully identified and understood, the optimist returns
the thinking to opportunity and possibility.
202 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

     Optimistic leaders acknowledge the downside of ev-
ery situation, then focus the majority of their thinking on
the upside. They also focus the majority of their commu-
nication on the upside. They know that the downside is
always well-known throughout the team. But the upside is
never as well-known. Who wants to look like an idiotic
optimist? It is far more popular and easy to be a clever
and witty pessimist. But it is not leadership.
     Optimism in the face of a grumbling and pessimistic
team takes courage and energy. It is something most team
members would never be willing to do. It is the heart and
soul of leadership. And while you may be questioned about
it now and then, in the end, the very end, when your work
is almost through, it is what your team members will love
you for the most.


                                96. Pay Attention
  Do not hope wholly to reason away your troubles; do not feed
 them with attention, and they will die imperceptibly away. Fix
    your thoughts upon your business, fill your intervals with
   company, and sunshine will again break in upon your mind.
                                          —Samuel Johnson

     Anything you pay attention to expands. It grows.
     Pay attention to your house plants and they grow. Pay
attention to your favorite cause, and your passion and
knowledge will grow the success of that cause. Attention
is like that. Anywhere you direct it, the object of that at-
tention grows.
                                      Pay Attention / 203

     When you talk to members of your team, keep paying
attention to the end results you want, not the effort to
achieve them. When you praise your managers, pay atten-
tion to results they achieved that you wanted, not the try-
ing, the effort, or the attempt to do it.
     Most managers miss this vital point; they keep reward-
ing the trying, not realizing that doing so sends the sub-
conscious message that trying is always enough. Their
people soon think that if they can show they’re making
efforts, if they can show activity, then there won’t be so
much focus on end results.
     Make sure you reward end results more than anything
else.
     If you do so, you’ll get better end results. You have to
be the one who keeps talking numbers if you want that
one person to hit his numbers.
     If, instead, you commiserate with how hard everything
is, and you acknowledge how hard everyone is trying, then
that’s what you’ll get: fewer results and more trying. What-
ever you praise, grows. Always. It’s the law of the harvest.
     Attention is powerful. Yet most people allow their at-
tention to be pushed and pulled around all day long by
outside forces. A chance phone call. Some annoying e-mail.
Somebody walking by their desk and asking a loaded ques-
tion. Attention gets spread too thinly this way.
     But your attention is like money. It is a precious trea-
sure. It is paid in to things. We say pay attention for a
reason. It is invested. It gets paid in to whatever you choose
to pay it in to. If you pay it in to the things you want (mea-
surable, numerical outcomes and specific results), you will
get more and more of what you want.

                          97. Create a Routine
  Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which
           difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish.
                                      —John Quincy Adams

    Leadership success is not easy, but it is not all that
hard, either.
    It is not nearly as hard as we often make it for ourselves.
    The major psychological obstacle to motivational suc-
cess is the myth of permanent characteristics. It is people
who think that their habits of action are not habits, but
permanent traits. Believing in that totally false myth traps
managers in a prison, an iron web of limitation. And it’s
all unnecessary!
    The repeated action patterns that you and I demon-
strate throughout the day are a result of habit, not the
result of permanent characteristics, or character defects,
or hard-wired personality traits.
    If we don’t like a certain tendency someone has (let’s
say to procrastinate having that important talk with a co-
worker), then the first step in correcting the tendency is
to see it for what it is: a habit. A habit is a pattern of
behavior woven into seeming permanence by repetition.
If I repeatedly and consistently put off doing the tough
tasks in favor of the easy ones, it will become a habit. It’s
the law of the human neurological system.
    So, what do we do?
    All we have to do to build a new habit is to create a
routine. That’s right, a routine! Please repeat to yourself,
I don’t need self-discipline for this, I don’t need a new
                                  Create a Routine / 205

personality, I don’t need fresh strength of character or
even more willpower. All I Need Is a Routine.
     Lyndon Duke, one of our top mentors and business
productivity coaches, once said that he had spent many
years lowering his self-esteem by bemoaning the condi-
tion of his chaotic apartment. He lived alone and was a
highly active business genius who worked many long and
joyful hours, but couldn’t keep his place clean. He told
himself that he was an undisciplined and disorganized per-
son. Soon, in his own mind, he was a slob. That is a perma-
nent characteristic: slob.
     Finally it dawned on him that the only thing missing
was a routine. That’s all he lacked! He didn’t lack will-
power, good character, or self-control. Not at all! He sim-
ply lacked a routine.
     So he made up a routine: I will straighten things up for
20 minutes every morning. Mondays, while coffee was brew-
ing, for just a few short and quick minutes, he would do his
living room. Tuesdays, his kitchen. Wednesdays, the bedroom.
Thursdays, the hall and porch. Fridays, the home office and
den. And each Saturday morning, for 20 minutes, he would
do a deeper cleaning of his choice. That became his routine.
The beauty of a routine is that it eventually becomes habit.
     At first, it was awkward and weird, he said. And I
thought to myself that it was so unnatural and uncomfort-
able that I would probably never follow through, but I
promised myself a 90-day free trial. I’d be free to drop it if
my theory was incorrect. My theory was that I only needed
a routine, and that once my routine became routine, it would
be an effortless and natural part of my life.
     He was absolutely correct about all of it. When we
first visited him at his apartment, long after his routine
206 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

had become habit, we noticed how clean and orderly it
looked. We assumed he had someone come in to clean.
Then he told us about the power, the absolutely stunning
and amazing power, of making up a routine.
     I do it so naturally now that sometimes I don’t even
remember having done it, he said. So I’ll have to look
out at my living room to check, and lo and behold, it’s in
complete order. I had done it without thinking.
     If something isn’t happening in your professional life,
if you could be more productive if only you were as disci-
plined as so and so, then worry no longer. It isn’t about
you. It’s about your lack of a routine. Make up your rou-
tine, and follow your routine, and if you do this for 90
days, it will be so effortless and natural to you that you’ll
never have to think about it again.
     Do you hate yourself because you don’t prepare for
your team meetings? There’s nothing wrong with you. You
just need a routine. Are you troubled by how your e-mail is
taking up your precious time and life as a leader? You aren’t
missing any kind of inner strength; you are missing a rou-
tine. Check your e-mail two specific times a day and tell
your people that’s what you do. Create a routine for your-
self. Follow your routine for 90 days. Then you’re free.


                       98. Deliver the Reward
     Love is always creative and fear is always destructive.
     If you could only love enough, you would be the most
                powerful person in the world.
                         —Emmet Fox, Author/Philosopher
                               Deliver the Reward / 207

    The most important principle of motivation is this: You
get what you reward.
    It’s true of every relationship. It’s true of pets, house
plants, children, and lovers. You get what you reward.
    It’s especially true of team motivation.
    Positive reinforcement of the desired behavior works
much faster and much more permanently than criticizing
poor behavior.
    Love conquers fear every time.
    Leaders who figure out, on their own, ways to reward
their people for good performance get more good perfor-
mances than leaders who run around all day putting out
fires caused by their people’s poor performance.
    The reason most people don’t maximize this reward
concept is that they wait too long to put it into effect.
They wait to decide whether to reward people, and soon,
before they know it, a big problem comes up to be dealt
with. By then it’s too late.
    Dedicate a certain portion of each day to rewarding
people, even if it’s only a verbal reward. Ten minutes at the
end of the day. Get on the phone. Send out some e-mails.
Reward. Reward. (Sometimes verbal and written rewards,
rather than financial bonuses and prizes, are the ones that
go the farthest in inspiring a person to do more.)
    Obtain a copy of Bob Nelson’s excellent study of how
companies reward their people, 1001 Ways to Reward
Employees, 2nd Edition (Workman Publishing Company,
2005), and read it with a yellow highlighter or a red pen in
hand. Everyone we know who does this increases their
team’s productivity. Everyone we know who does this un-
derlines and highlights completely different parts of the
208 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

book and then translates the ideas into ideas that fit their
style. Most of the ideas don’t take any extra time, just
extra commitment to reward.
    But you’ll get what you reward.


                                       99. Slow Down
 Nothing so conclusively proves a man’s ability to lead others as
         what he does from day to day to lead himself.
                    —Thomas J. Watson, Former CEO, IBM

     You’ll lead better if you slow down. You’ll get more
done, too.
     It doesn’t seem like it would be true. It doesn’t seem
like slowing down would get that much more done. But it
does. Every day you do it, you will get more done. Every
day you experiment with slowing down, you will under-
stand the truth behind the legend of the tortoise and the
hare.
     The most important element of slowing down is to know
that you’re always working on the right thing to be work-
ing on at any given time. Business consultant Chet Holmes
says that he and his clients accomplish that by making sure
each day has only six things on the Must Do list. That list
lets them slow down.
     Why only six things? says Holmes. Because with a
bigger list than that, generally you just try to trim the list.
You spend the day trimming the list. At the end of the day
you feel that most of the important things on the list did
not get completed. You just look down and say, ‘Oh, I
                                 Decide to Be Great / 209

didn’t do the most important things.’ There’s a bad psy-
chological impact in not finishing your list! And so only
list the six most important things…and then make sure
you get them done. You’ll be amazed at how much you’ve
accomplished.
     If I am on the wrong road, it doesn’t matter how good
I get at speeding down the road. It’s still the wrong road.
     I need to remind myself to slow down and win. I need
to take my sweet, gentle time. I want this conversation
ahead of me to be relaxed and strong so that the relation-
ship I have becomes relaxed and strong. So all day, it helps
to tell myself: Slow down. Even slower than that.
     There you go.


                     100. Decide to Be Great
 When life demands more of people than they demand of life—as
is ordinarily the case—what results is a resentment of life almost
                as deep-seated as the fear of death.
                                      —Tom Robbins, Author

     Either now or on one’s deathbed, one realizes a strange
truth: There’s no excuse for not being great.
     If you are a leader, a leader is what you are. If you are
still just a manager, just managing to manage, well, maybe
you’ll manage, but how fulfilling is that? How proud is your
subconscious mind of you? How proud is your family?
     Someday you will just decide to be great at what you do.
You’ll never look back. You’ll never regret the decision. It
might not have seemed like a big deal at the moment you
210 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

decided, but somehow you’ll know the decision is final. It
will never have to be revisited.
     There’s a reason why it’s good to be great: people want
to follow you. People start to respect you. People want to
be more like you. People want to do things for you.
     And if you are honest with yourself, you will someday real-
ize the truth for yourself, either now, or on your deathbed:

     There was no excuse for not being great.


                        101. Let Them See You
                             Change and Grow
             Everyone thinks of changing the world,
             but no one thinks of changing himself.
                                             —Leo Tolstoy

    There’s a reason why advertisers always look for ways
to use real people in before and after pictures. Nothing
motivates a buyer more! You as a leader can keep tapping
into that ultimate motivational tool—your own growth.
Your people will always remember what you used to be
like, and see what you’re like now.
    Nothing inspires and motivates people as much as
watching someone else change for the better. When you
are willing to offer yourself up as a role model for per-
sonal change, you’ll motivate your people faster than any-
thing else you can do. Watch what happens when your
team sees you evolve, change, and grow. It’s inspiring for
them to see that you yourself are not cast in stone, locked
in to your own hardened habits of leadership.
          Let Them See You Change and Grow / 211

    It’s exciting for people to witness your courageous
evolution. When your employee fills out a form that evalu-
ates you as a leader, you want their most telling comment
about you to be how they admire your own willingness to
grow.
    And this growth can take place in absolutely any cat-
egory. So you never have to stop looking for areas that
have potential for you to demonstrate your own willing-
ness to challenge yourself.
    For example, let’s look at your physical condition. Why
not? Everyone else is. Does that make you uncomfort-
able? That they would even notice something like that?
They shouldn’t! How judgmental! How irrelevant!
    Well, let’s just face up to it. Your physical condition
will always be observed by everyone who works for you.
Just as you always observe everyone else’s. Perhaps it
shouldn’t be so. Maybe it shouldn’t be a factor, but it is. If
you are in poor condition, or overweight, or easily out of
breath, you are less likely to be someone’s inspiration. But
that’s good! Because you now have an opportunity. By
taking up a new health program you can transform, physi-
cally, right before the eyes of your people. This is one of
the most dramatic ways to be a role model for discipline
and self-control ever.
    Steve recalls: I once lost 16 pounds by doing an exten-
sive outdoor walking program and using the diet we intro-
duced in Two Guys Read Moby Dick (Robert D. Reed
Publishers, 2006). When I went back to do a workshop
with a large team I’d worked with six months before, I was
amazed at how many people came up and talked to me about
the change in my appearance. I didn’t think it mattered that
much. But when I realized how pale and overweight I had
212 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

been when they saw me six months ago compared to now,
I got the picture. People care a lot whether you look healthy,
vibrant, and alive. They associate poor physical condition
with a kind of giving up inside…a depressed kind of cav-
ing in to last-ditch self-comforting.
     Studies show that if you appear strong and fit, you’ll
be better able to motivate others. Their subconscious re-
sponse to you has more respect in it. On a subtle, psycho-
logical level, they admire your own commitment to
excellence and discipline. (It’s much harder to work hard
for someone who does not take care of herself or himself.)
     Even changes in attire can be motivational (on a very
subtle level, but it’s true). As you take more care dressing
well, it sends a message that life is good! It sends the mes-
sage that this profession is important to you, so you want
to look your best. You’re a leader! So people notice when
you upgrade your appearance in any way.
     Learning another language is a very challenging project,
and we’re not suggesting you take it on just to make an
impression. But if it’s something you were considering for
professional or personal reasons, don’t put it off. Because
it’s very inspiring to other people and often motivates them
to expand their own skills in some category. Scott speaks
fluent Spanish and Chinese, and the people at his law firm
who get to see those skills demonstrated are inspired to
use their own brains in new and powerful ways.
     Being a better speaker and meeting facilitator is open
to anyone. Steve taught a class to graduate students at
the University of Santa Monica in presentation skills for
leaders.
     He said, It’s astonishing to me that even though many
top level leaders in an organization speak to groups of
          Let Them See You Change and Grow / 213

people regularly, they very rarely enroll in a specific pro-
gram to improve their skills.
    We’ve seen CEOs laugh off their own speaking skills
and say, I just try to be brief. Limit the damage! I’m
not going to fool anyone. I’m not a pro. I’ll just read my
notes and be as brief as I can be. Thank goodness for
PowerPoint.
    And what a missed opportunity that is. What if
Churchill had taken that approach? There would have been
no rallying of the British people to stand up to Hitler. Some-
times the very things leaders dismiss or try to get out of
are what could turn the morale of the whole organization
around.
    All human beings have the potential to speak well be-
fore a group. If you never dip into yours, you’re not going
to be much of an inspiration to anyone.
    We recommend that you, as a leader, take the Dale
Carnegie classes (or some equivalent) in public presenta-
tion, and then let your people see the difference in your
speaking skills. As you get better and better in front of a
room of people, those same people will see the growth as
it occurs.
    If speaking is already something you do well, you might
choose listening as your next growth skill. Listening, compro-
mise, positive reinforcement, compassionate relationship-
building, and all the other skills that build trust and
understanding. There are books such as The Relationship
Handbook  by George
Pransky and our own 50 Ways to Create Great Relationships
 that give a dramatic crash course in
eliminating the sick ego in human communications. The
University of Santa Monica’s Spiritual Psychology program
214 / 100 Ways to Motivate Others

teaches leaders the deepest and most thoroughly gener-
ous listening skills on the planet. Many leaders we have
worked with have enrolled in that program with dramatic
turnarounds in team morale as a result. When you, as a
true leader, learn to listen, everything opens up.
     You may choose customer relations as your next skill
to improve. You can read Darby Checketts’s Customer
Astonishment (Robert D. Reed Publishers, 2006) and Posi-
tive Conflict (Career Pres, 2006) and take those books to
heart. Your people will be astonished at how differently
you treat customers and how much new business comes in
as a result. They will remember you being rather brief and
professional in demeanor with customers before, but
now see you opening up to becoming a completely new
you with whom customers love to brainstorm.
     When your people watch this, they get motivated like
no other system or trick for motivating others will do.
Why does it work so well? It’s the hardest thing to do, and
your people know it.
     A lot of older managers think it’s cute or curmudg-
eonly to not want to learn any of the newer communica-
tion technologies. While the younger employees thrive on
all kinds of cool new ways to communicate by phone,
text, and videoconferencing, the stuck-in-the-past leader
refuses to learn the new ways.
     A wonderful opportunity for personal growth is in the
technical field. Every leader should subscribe to WIRED
magazine and read it voraciously! You’ll surprise every-
one (in the most pleasant way) if you challenge yourself
to stay current and continuously add new technical and
Internet skills to your repertoire. When a new IT system
comes in, you can be the first to learn it and embrace it.


    No one is really motivated by a same-ol’, same-ol’,
stuck-in-the-past manager. If you think it’s always a good
thing to be falsely consistent as the same person you
always were (stuck in an outdated rut), you are simply
wrong.
     Most managers believe they don’t have time to im-
prove themselves by adding a new skill. They think they’d
never have time to take a Dale Carnegie speaking class at
night or fly into a weekend session at the University of
Santa Monica because that’s the time they reserve for
stressing out over e-mails, or studying the sales reports,
or being upset with their families.
     But it isn’t a matter of time, it’s a matter of commit-
ment. It’s a bold move to grow yourself in a new direction.
That’s why it’s so motivating for others to watch you do it.
     When you pick your next category in which you im-
prove yourself, make sure you really dive into it. Take it
on with a passion. If you have a leadership coach (and we
can recommend some good ones if you contact us at
www.stevechandler.com), use that coach! Let him or her
hold you accountable for dramatic change so that your
people can see it and think wow. Don’t go through your
life in leadership never tapping into that wow factor.
It’s always available to you. Not to mention the effect it
will have on you yourself. As the great poet-philosopher
William Butler Yeats said, Happiness is neither this thing
nor that…it is simply growth. We are happy when we are
growing.
